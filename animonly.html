<P>The AnimOnly tool strips geometry from a .NIF file, leaving only animation data behind. It's located in the Tools directory. To use it, just drag a file to it (or call it from the command line with the file to be processed as the parameter). It will strip the geometry and then leave you with only the animation data.</P>
