<H1>Requirements</H1>

<P>
These are some other things that you might want to have installed, or are required to use certain parts of the SDK.
<UL>
<LI>An external installation of <A HREF="http://www.python.org/">Python</A>, if you want to use the AI editor. This is also nice to have because it comes with an editor that does Python syntax highlighting. Bridge Commander uses Python 1.5.2 internally, but the AI editor should work with any later version as well.</LI>
<LI><A HREF="http://pmw.sourceforge.net/">Python Megawidgets</A>, also required for the AI editor.</LI>
<LI>Microsoft Word 2000 (or later), if you want to use the TGL exporter (used for exporting localizable strings for the game).</LI>
<LI>Some experience with <A HREF="http://www.python.org/">Python</A>. This SDK does not contain any sort of Python tutorial or reference, except for things that are particular to Bridge Commander.</LI>
<LI>Some knowledge of object-oriented programming, particularly inheritance.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>
If you are making extensive changes to the game, it is recommended that you work on a separate copy. Multiplayer Bridge Commander requires players to be using the same versions of most scripts, and will not allow you to play if this is the case. (You can optionally auto-download the files, but this will overwrite your versions.)
</P>
<P>
If you are primarily interested in making missions, the above step is not necessary.
