PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
___________________

This program is the intended replacement of the BCMP/BCMI updated for today's standards. It is also the successor of the Bridge Commander Ship Menu Creator (aka BCSMC). 

It has been completely rewritten from scratch and has been made more user friendly. It has something for every ones taste. 

If you want to quickly create ship plugins, Basic BCSMC is the right choice for you (just point and click). If you want to create multiple plugins at once, Fast BCSMC is the choice for you.

If you like to customize plugins fully, add techs for your ships or customize ship descriptions in great lengths Advanced BCSMC is the tool for you. It allows you virtually to customize all aspects of a ship plugin. 

If you like to edit plugins, you can use the Plugin Editor which can load most of the plugins out there. If there is a problem with the plugin it will notify you.

It is also capable of importing TGL based descriptions created by BCMP. It can import them directly to a ship plugin or merge them with the ships.tgl (file which holds all ship descriptions). It is recommended to import the descriptions to the plugin file.

For N00bs out there, there is a detailed guide on how to create a modded install (N00b 101). There is also a tool which creates a shortcut for you which you can use to launch BC in TestMode.

It is fully compatible with older mods as it can extract BCMod files, which are of an older standard.

You can use it to create sound plugins for you weapons\engines. It can also edit and create TGL Files, it is also capable of loading "corrupt" tgl files which no other tgl editor will load. You can use it to fix those broken files so you won't have to lose any data.

It can backup your BC scripts folder which you can always restore at a click of a button. It is also capable of creating Ship Carrier plugins and is capable of uninstalling Ship Mods.

BCUT allows you also to tweak up values in your ships hardpoint, please note that this feature does not replace MPE fully. 

It comes with the latest Foundation build, however it also allows you to install the Basic Foundation.

As old BCSMC, BCUT also comes with NanoFX Atmospheres Fix and QB Description Fix. Remember to install QB Description Fix if you use Ship Description Writer for your descriptions.
