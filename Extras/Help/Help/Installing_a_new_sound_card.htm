              <p><font face="Arial">If you install a new sound card into your
              system after you have installed the game, you may need to <a href="Uninstalling_the_game.htm">uninstall</a>
              and <a href="Installing_the_game.htm">reinstall</a>
              the game in order to get it to properly recognize the new
              hardware. Be sure to uninstall using the uninstaller, other
              methods of deleting the game are not recommended.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">Be sure you are using a 100% DirectX®
              8.0a-compatible sound card and driver capable of playing 16-bit
              digital audio. Sometimes Windows® 95 fails to recognize your
              peripheral. If this happens, please consult your Windows 95
              manual.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">Some sound cards are advertised as 16-bit
              sound cards, while not really being capable of playing 16-bit
              sound. Many of these cards go into a 16-bit bus slot on your
              motherboard, yet only emulate Sound Blaster or Sound Blaster Pro
              8-bit sound. Should you experience problems with your sound card,
              you may wish to review the documentation that came with it to
              verify that the card has 16-bit playback capability.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial">Through our testing, we have found that many
              of the combination sound/modem cards that come in many consumer
              model PC's are not capable of playing back 16-bit digital audio.
              Please consult the manufacturer of your PC for more information.</font></p>
