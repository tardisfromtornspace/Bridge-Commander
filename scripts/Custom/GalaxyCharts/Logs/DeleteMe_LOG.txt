this is just a simply text file located in the Logs folder, so that this folder actually has any file in the pack.
to prevent any problems by installation/extraction errors that may happen because the Logs folder wasn't properly installed
 or extracted because it didn't had any files...


So, if you, Galaxy Charts user, are reading this, you can delete this file without problems (after installing of course).
