# SPECIFIC SUB-TECH MANUAL:
# This file takes care of how B5 defences are affected by SG Ori Beam Weapons.
# At the moment, Ori Beam weapons have more than enough power to pass through, but some of the ships need to have a resistance due to how their defences were coded and/or were previously balanced to older Ori Beams where rapid-repair shields could counteract or nullify part of a beam if they were not too close.

# NOTE: Imports and additional functions may be necessary here as well, depending on how creative the sub-tech becomes

global OriBeamB5LegacyShieldDamageMultiplier
OriBeamB5LegacyShieldDamageMultiplier = 0.2

global OriBeamB5LegacyHullDamageMultiplier
OriBeamB5LegacyHullDamageMultiplier = 0.1 

### With that said, some B5 defences (as well as Hull Polarization) canonically would at least protect a bit from direct hull damage. Since we did the thing above to guarantee ships without shields lore-wise still take decent shield damage, we must ensure that those vessel's hull damage defences are not bypassed completely.
defenceGridMultiplier = 0.99
hullPolarizerMultiplier = 0.7
shadowDispersiveHullMultiplier = 0.9
shadowDispersiveHullMin = 0.3

### Some ships that from legacy reasons are extra vulnerable to this weapon in some way - for these ones is because B5 defences and STBC shields work differently
