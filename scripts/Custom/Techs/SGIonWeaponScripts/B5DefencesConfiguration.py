# SPECIFIC SUB-TECH MANUAL:
# This file takes care of how B5 defences are affected by SG Ion Weapons.
# Babylon 5 - between the fact that lore-wise Babylon 5 has no shields except Vree, Abbai, Vorlons, potentially other First Ones, and Thirdspace Aliens; and that mod-wise the latest Babylon 5 super-pack mods already have alternatives of defense against these weapons such as Simulated Point Defense, and that for certain vessels a semblance of a shield was kept for blocking or imitating phaser absorption, we must guarantee that some Ion Weapons can still surpass that token shield threshold in some way to work as intended for certain vessels.

# NOTE: Imports and additional functions may be necessary here as well, depending on how creative the sub-tech becomes

IonB5LegacyShieldDamageMultiplier = 5.0 

### With that said, some B5 defences (as well as Hull Polarization) canonically would at least protect a bit from direct hull damage. Since we did the thing above to guarantee ships without shields lore-wise still take decent shield damage, we must ensure that those vessel's hull damage defences are not bypassed completely.
defenceGridMultiplier = 0.95 # Used for legacy reasons
hullPolarizerMultiplier = 0.7
shadowDispersiveHullMultiplier = 0.9
shadowDispersiveHullMin = 0.6

### Some ships that from legacy reasons are extra vulnerable to this weapon in some way - for these ones is because B5 defences and STBC shields work differently
