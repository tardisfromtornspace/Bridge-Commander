# SPECIFIC SUB-TECH MANUAL:
# This file takes care of how SG shielding is affected by SG AsgardBeam Weapons.
# The reason we make a tech for this, is mostly as a way to allow a non-ZPM BC-304 to resist its own Asgard Beam, while not being so powerful it could shrug the most powerful SG weapons.
# And even between SG shields, some behave differently:

# On this case, more info about SG shields will be reviewed on their main SG Shields technology
# NOTE: Imports and additional functions may be necessary here as well, depending on how creative the sub-tech becomes
