# SPECIFIC SUB-TECH MANUAL:
# This file adds disruptors to the list of guaranteed bleedthrough to ME Shields, according to MEShields in-script documentation. Due to the parent script implementation, we could add multiple files that add elements, and repeated elements on the lists will not be repeatedly included on the parent script

# NOTE: Imports and additional functions may be necessary here as well, depending on how creative the sub-tech becomes
import App
from bcdebug import debug
import traceback

# Some global variables could be used as well
# On this case, we want to add the equivalent to this:
#{"ProjectileName": {"GuaranteedBleedthrough": 0.1, "WhitelistFilename": ["Quantum", "QuantumTorpedo"], "BlacklistName": ["not a quantum", "not quantum", "no quantum", "anti-quantum", "antiquantum", "quantumania"], "BlacklistFilename": ["AntiQuantum", "Quantumania"]}

#ProjectileName = "borg array"
#ProjectileGuaranteedBleedthrough = 0.75
#ProjectileWhitelistFilename = []  # Case-sensitive
#ProjectileBlacklistName = []  # Case-insensitive
#ProjectileBlacklistFilename = []  # Case-sensitive
#ProjRacesImmune = ["Reaper"]

# Below here we have an example for beams
# {"BeamName": {"GuaranteedBleedthrough": 0.05, "WhitelistHardname": ["Ventral Phaser 1"], "BlacklistName": ["not a phaser", "notphaser", "laser", "nophaser"]}
