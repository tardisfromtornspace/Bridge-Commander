Foundation.ShipDef.ColLine6.desc = 'Passenger Liners are possibly the most common single class of ship in the Twelve Colonies. Numerous different companies all rely on the same basic model. These liners are primarily used only for very short trips either at sub-light for short distances or for FTL jumps. They are not intended for long voyages and consist mostly of rows of passenger seats with very basic bathroom and food services and a minimal flight crew. Efforts have been made to redistribute the populations of these ships, but even at half capacity the liners are still considered the worst ships in the Fleet to live on. The Olympic Carrier was following the fleet in several FTL jumps but was lost on the 238th jump.The fleet had no idea that the Carrier was missing until the ships began to report in. The Olympic Carrier was finaly destroyed because it was set on autopilot by the Cylons to fly into the Galactica and explode'
