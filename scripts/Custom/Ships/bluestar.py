Built by the Interstellar Alliance, these ships were a common sight over the central planet Minbar by 2281 and in service as early as 2263. President John Sheridan piloted his personal White Star from Minbar to Babylon 5 and then Coriana VI shortly before Babylon 5Â´s decommissioning ceremony. His ship was later found adrift in the Coriana system, empty and with all its airlocks sealed.'
