It was the eleventh Federation ship to bear the name Voyager with this registry. When Osyraa commandeered Discovery to enter the Federation Headquarters' protective shield and began attacking, Admiral Vance instructed Voyager to take the lead on attacking the Viridian while the rest of the fleet targeted Discovery. Voyager was then part of the Federation-Ni'Var fleet that pursued Discovery and the Viridian, and acknowledged instructions from Discovery to back to a safe distance when Discovery planned to detonate their warp core."
