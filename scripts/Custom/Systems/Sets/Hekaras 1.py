Description = "The Hekaras 1 planet is much alike Hekaras 2: a class-O planet with a class-D and a class-N planet. However this area of the system is outside of the Hekaras Corridor, and as such, has deeply suffered from the effect of the high concentration of Tetryon particles and subspace radiation, and is inhospitable now."
