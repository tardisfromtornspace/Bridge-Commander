Description = "This is the only set of what's left of the Psi Colony system. Besides the Psi Blackhole, a star and a Class M planet can be found here as well. This planet is actually the last planet of the system, which had 8 planets and 2 stars.  The system, while still being 'developed', had a promissing economical and strategical value, however due to the evacuation of this system, it doesn't have any importance anymore."
