Description = "System containing a wormhole and a Cardassian Starbase called Deep Space 9. Bajor is a strategical important region of space. It has 14 planets and 1 sun. It's importance was greatly increased when the stable Bajoran Wormhole that leads deep into the Gamma Quadrant was found, thus the strategical and economical values of this region are pretty high, and it's defence is also high, considering the Dominion War."
