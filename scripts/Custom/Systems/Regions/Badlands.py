Description = "The Badlands is a region of space located at the border of Cardassian territory, known by it's severe continous plasma storms, that makes space travelling very dangerous. It was also the location at which the USS Voyager was lost, later to be discovered that she had been transported to the Delta Quadrant. However, even being of very small economical importance, this system is still patrolled by Cardassians, considering that it is a strategical location."
