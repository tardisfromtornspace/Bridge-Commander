Description = "Foothold of the Borg in the Beta Quadrants. It is a binary star-system, one of the first conquered by the Borg in their incursion into Federation territory, however this one in particular, situated more farter, around 7000 lightyears, of the Known Space region, was not discovered by the Federation, and so it served as a foothold to the Borg. While they have no stations set up here, it's importance is mostly based on the 'foothold' factor, and the planet that they colonized, plus they didn't lost communications with the Borg Queen, and as such, this system can send out distress signals to receive reinforcements from a Transwarp Hub in the Delta Quadrant. It was in this system that the Federation first encountered the Borg in the TNG episode 'Q Who'."
