Description = "A single star-system, used by the Cardassians as a junkyard, to store the hulks of captured enemy ships that have no longer any use. A funny fact is that it also contains 2 cardassian vessels, meaning that some time ago they had to attack ships of their own, probably rebels or stolen vessels.[-162.5, 25825.6]"
