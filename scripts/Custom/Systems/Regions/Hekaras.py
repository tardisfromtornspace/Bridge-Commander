Description = "The Hekaras single star-system is a canon Star Trek system (however this may not be it's canon location), as showed in the The Next Generation series. It is a system deeply affected by warp engines, which because of it's extensive use thru out the known area of space has 'filled' this system with tetryon particles, resulting in the inpossibility of using warp drives in this system and small subspace anomalies, except for the small area known as 'Hekaras Corridor' which contains the last remaining habitable world of the Hekaras system. Because of this, the Federation has made strict policies about the use of warp drives in this region, and it is also believed that in the future, the subspace anomalies will end up in 'destroying' what is left of the Hekaras system."
