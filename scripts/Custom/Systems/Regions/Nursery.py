Description = "A beautiful multiple star-system. It's beauty comes from the incredible astronomical phenomenom found here:  the birth of various stars.  But proving that everything pretty has some teeth, the gravitational forces here can be quite strong because of the various stars, plus it is not advised to pass in unsafe distances to these stars, as they can be quite dangerous, like any other star."
