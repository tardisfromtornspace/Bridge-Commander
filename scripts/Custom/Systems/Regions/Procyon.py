Description = "Procyon, also called Alpha Canis Minoris (a real star-system), is a binary star-system located close to the Sol system, and even closer to Vulcan. Being most notable for the fact that in an alternate future, the battle were the Sphere Builders were defeated was fought here in the 26th century. It is also believed to be the home-system of the Andorians. (however, in my research the Procyon system is said to have 5 sets, while this one has only 3, and one of them is empty)"
