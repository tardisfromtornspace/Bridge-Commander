Description = "A single neutron star-system. It has no planets of any kind, but instead contains various nebulas and some organical and inert debris. Some theories say that this is a 'baby' star-system, still being formed. Other theories say that this was the site of a massive battle of long ago, that destroyed the planet that lied here. In any case, this system isn't controlled by any race today."
