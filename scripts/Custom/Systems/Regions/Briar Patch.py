Description = "The Briar Patch is a small region of space, which contains a binary star system with various nebulae and some planets, completely surrounded by Federation-controlled space. The most important planet here is the Ba'ku homeworld which is friendly to the Federation, however this region has been taken by Son'a forces, so Federation ships may encounter a fight if they enter here."
