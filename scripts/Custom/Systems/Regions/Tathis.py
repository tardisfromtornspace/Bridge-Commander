Description = "The Tathis binary star-system, located near the border betweem Federation and Klingon space, holds a Federation Reseach Station. It was created some time after the alliance of the Khitomer treaty between the Federation and the Klingon Empire. It is a joint-venture of these 2 races, but because of it's location inside Klingon space, the major control of it was in the Klingons hands, altho the Federation plays a equal role of the Klingons in the researches made here."
