Description:

This is the Basestar from the Original series of BSG. It is a 8km dreadnaught, and the backbone of the Cylon fleet. It is heavely armed, and comes with a compliment of 300 Mk 10 Raiders.

Thankx to:

Other Stuff

Weapons Stuff -
	Dont give me grief about the weapons damage level, these weapons were designed to 'Take Down' the heavely armoured Battlestar\Basestars, so when it blows six colours of s*!t out of your Sov dont come running to me crying, It is powerfull but its main beams have a long recharge rate, "its about as cannon as you get in BSG". Besides I have only Hardpointed HALF the TurboLasers and Launch Tubes these ships have; to compensate. This is more on par with an ISD, but with better weapons coverage.
	Likewise with the Projectiles, they have seriously overpower warheads but they have slow launch spead and poor tracking. They are a bit like stock torpedoes, but pack a much bigger punch.

Tactics:	Avoid direct engagement unless necessary, let your fighters do the work. The exception is if your enemy has a Carrier Class vessel. In this case KILL THE CARRIER FAST. For close in defense switch targets often to discourage them from getting too close.
