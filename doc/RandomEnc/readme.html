		<h1>Random Encounters 1.0</h1>
		<br>
		<i>by Banbury</i> (<A HREF="mailto:baley5@excite.com">baley5@excite.com</A>)
		<p>This is a custom mission for Star Trek: Bridge Commander.</p>
		<p>Install the Mod with BC-Mod Installer.</p>
		<p>Start Bridge Commander with the -TestMode option then choose 'RandomEnc' from 
			the 'Custom Missions' folder.</p>
		<p>You start at Starbase 12 with a random fleet with up to three ships under your 
			command. When you enter a different system, you will be attacked by a random 
			enemy fleet. You can return to Starbase 12 at any time for repairs. But enemy 
			ships will follow you there and might attack the starbase. And the starbase 
			won't defend itself. After destroying one wave of enemy ships, a new enemy 
			fleet will be spawned when you enter another system. The mission ends when your 
			ship is destroyed.</p>
		<p>Right now only stock ships are spawned. If you want to add ships or races you 
			have to change the file Fleets.py.<br>
			For example if you want to add the Borg to the FleetList, add the following 
			line to the file:</p>
		<code>'Borg': ['BorgCube', 'DYSphere']</code>
		<p>The ship names have to be written exactly as in the 'scripts\ship' folder. (Of 
			course the ships have to be installed before you can use them.)</p>
		<p>Let me know if you enjoy this mission and maybe I will add more features to the 
			next version.</p>
