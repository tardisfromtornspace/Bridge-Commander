A very under-represented ship from Star Trek: FC - The Sabre class. I always had a soft spot for this class so decided to potter around with it.  This file includes two ships: The USS Sabre NX-61932 (conjectural registry) and the USS Yeager NCC-61947. Due to the lack of phaser coverage, the ship is highly maneuverable and has the additional support of wide arc torpedoes set as a pulse script. These better mimick the turrets as seen very briefly in ST:FC.I have also added an aft phaser bank under artistic licence.

NOTE: This will not overwrite any other ships unless they are named Sabre (English spelling) or Yeager. If you do have older versions with the same name, remove all instances of them from your BC install before copying these over.

The model weighs in at 5881 polys and uses 4 x 1024x512 maps with speculars included and Medium and Low textures.

The weapons fit is as follows:
5 phaser arrays (2 per dorsal array for better coverage), 1 aft phaser bank
1 forward photn turret
2 aft photon turrets

Installation:
//Latest Foundation plug-in needed
//NanoFX2 needed for running lights
1.Unzip contents into a new folder and copy the 'Data', 'Scripts' & 'sfx' folders into your Bridge Commander root directory. If asked to overwrite files, click yes to all. 
2.Use Bridge Commander Mod Packager to import the ship.
3.Enjoy.

Bugs:
There are some mesh errors on parts of the hull - this may be due to the Milkshape exporter
