Mod Time: 3 Hours
Author: Blackrook32

Texture Modified: Stock Bridge Commander & the AGT Uniform TC v.1.0


Mod Discription:
____________________________________________

This is an updated mod from the All Good Things Uniform TC. And a preview of the Bajoran Militia Uniform TC. This mod will also be seen
in the DS9FX mod by USS_Sovereign. Though this uniform is far from perfect. I tried to make a believable one for BC. When this mod was
made back in 2002. I had not see the final season of DS9 until 2004. So, I did not know Kira Neryes made Colonel. And a new cat suite to
boot! Since Bajoran Militia uniforms are unisex. I made it so by differing from male and female. This is a stand alone mod, and will not
overwrite any other mod.

This character textures is a .TGA High Resolution file. This mod will not show up in game if your a using your graphic settings on "Medium" or "Low".

Changes:
________

* Head/Neck - HeadKira.TGA file corrected around the collar

* Canon Bajoran Militia pendant added on uniform neck/collar
