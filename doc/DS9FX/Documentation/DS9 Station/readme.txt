c2x Deep Space Nine - v1 (Feb 2005)

Notes:

Both Blackrook and myself have been hanging onto this mod for a year now and thought
it was finally due for a release, it will only gather dust on my Hard drive. It should
have canon weapons and sounds. It has 2 versions a starbase version (means A.I. will use
multi-targeting) and a player version which is located in the "Federation Ships" menu

Requirements:

Bridge Commander 1.1
BCMI 1.0 - higher
Winzip/Winrar

Installation:

Unzip the .BCMOD file and double click on it, BCMI will do the rest. Then just run the game
