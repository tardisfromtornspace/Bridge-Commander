	- The beta testers.

	To all those who have ever created custom weapons in BC.

Bugs/issues:
	A few;
	None of the Torp Scripts have custom sounds.
	Some of the torpedoes may freeze the game if played in windowed mode, this is due to a bad speciestotorp definition, 	
	I am working on it!
	The type2 Quantum torpedo core needs its texture putting on an alpha channel. (Currentle has a black box around it)

	Please: If you come accross any of the above bugs, let me know which tactical file is causing it!
	If you come accross any others, let me know!
	For game freezes, caused by torp script problems, please provide a Console dump,its probably the speciestotorp, but best to make sure!
	

For the future:

	Converting this to a BCMOD file.

	See Bugs/issues
