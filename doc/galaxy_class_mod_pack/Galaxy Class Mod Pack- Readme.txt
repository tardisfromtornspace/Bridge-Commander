This mod pack will not replace "any" Galaxy mod you may have installed, or P81's Galaxy Mod. These mods are compatable with Apollo's Advanced Technologies Pack (ATP). And Sneaker98's Multi-Vectored Assault Mode (MVAM 2.0). Each ship have thier own custom icon along with new scripts written to be compatable with the QB/QBR related mods. So the "sister ships" will show up on your (Federation Ship) selection list. 

The Special features added to the Galaxy Class and Venture Upgrade are more realistic hardpoints. Showing the Class(s) abilities as related in the TNG/DS9 series. Ex: Port and Starboard Ramscoops, Replicator Networks located threw out the ship. Main Computer Cores, Anti Matter Pods, and the favorite Ten Forward Lounge.  The most notiable is the canon 'Phaser Precharge Arc(s)' you will see in combat.  Also the Phaser Arrays will still function even if portions of it are damaged.

Each ship will have (4) torpedo choice, a different combination amoung the fleet. The phasers have been streamlined from the bulky stock version. Some of the torpedo mod included will have spread capability. Compatible only with (ATP3). Thought the mod pack's hp's have been configured for (ATP and ATP3) it is not a requirement to play the ships in game.

The Trinculo is a starship mostly manned by Vulcans, accounting for 2/3 rds of the total crew population of 1,112. The Trinculo is assinged to defend the Federation/Romulan border. On Stardate: 42234.06 the Trinculo encountered a random wormhole that flung the ship 3,000 light years into Romulan Space. Listed as "Missing in Space". The damaged Trinculo had to fight her way back to Federation space. When the Romulans discovered one of the most advanced Federation Starships so deep within thier space. It was considered a valuable 'prize' by the Romulan Imperial Senate and the infamous Tal'Shair. The Romulan Government feared the information the Trinculo could amass information on the state of unrest in the Empire. The Starship Trinculo under the Command of Captain S'var, eluded the best of the Imperial Romulan Fleet. Enduring heavy damage. With no support facilities, the Trinculo was aided by sympathic Romulan Colonies and subjugated Alien races under Imperial Romulan rule. 

On Stardate: 44580.12 Chief Medical Officer Kathlyn Stewart discovered a security breech in the Crew's Medical Database. This incident was reported to Security Chief Sovak. At this time the Romulans always was one step ahead of the Trinculo. On Stardate: 44999.2  the Romulans ambushed the Trinculo at D'era Prime. The ship was cripped and boarded by the Tal'Shiar. Damaged the Trinculo was tractored to the nearest Tal'Shar facility. When the Romulan Military intercept the Tal'Shiar enroute. It was discovered that Lt. Sovak was the Tal'Shiar Operative was onboard the Trinculo, disguised to look Vulcan. Lt. Sovak toke Dr. Stewart hostage but escaped, when Captain S'var engaged Sovar in a violent fight In MainEngineering. As the Trinculo's Marines toke back the ship. And escaped from the Tal'Shiar facility. The Trinculo's defiance of the mighty Romulan Star Empire cause many subjugated worlds to rise in revolt. As rumors about unrest in theRomulan Empire began to filter threw out the Alpha Quadrant.

Though rumors of a Federation ship fighting her way out of Romulan Space reached Starfleet Intellegence. The Romulan Government denied any knowleged of this reoprt. During this time the Humans onboard call the "Year of Hell". With Sub Commander Sovak's assistance, the Romulans were able to inflict massive damage to the Trinculo's port nacelle mainifold, which was never fully repaired. Any source to repair the damage was watched by the Romulans. 

On Stardate: 46992.01 the Trinculo breeched the Neutral Zone with two Romulan Warbirds in hot pursuit. The Trinculo's Port nacelle manifolds exploded in mid combat. Taking multiple hits from the Warbirds,  the Nebula Class U.S.S. Farragut and Excelsior Class U.S.S. Berlin responded to the Trinculo's distress call. One of the Warbirds was lead by Sub Commander Sovak. The Trinculo was able to unicciate a saucer seperation, Starfleet forces out numbered the Romulans 2 to 1. With Sovak's Warbird destroyed by the Trinculo's Stardrive. The remaining Warbird retreated back to Romulan Space. 

The Trinculo escorted by the Starships Farragut and Berlin, returned to Sector 0001 to a Hero's welcome by Starfleet Command. And a much needed retro-fit. Orbiting the Earth's Alpha One's Docking facility. The Trinculo scans of the inner sectors of Romulan space during her ordeal were invaluable. Providing a insight into the Romulan Infrastructure and the political/social climate. This information was the one thing the Romulan Senate or the Tal'Shiar did not want revealed to the Major Alpha Quadrant powers. The Starship Trinculo served as the Command ship in the liberating force in the Battle of Betazed. The Starship Trinculo was apart of the unpresidented alliance between the Federation/Klingon/Romulan task force in the Battle of Cardassia Prime.
