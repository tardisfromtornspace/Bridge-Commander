<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">By
default, Bridge Commander allows a great deal of moddability, but
adding new ships requires users to download the SDK and edit the .py
files. This is a tedious process, and it is unfeasible to distribute,
say, an edited QuickBattle.py for every ship out there if you want
multiple mods on a single installation.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">This is
a system to allow easy integration of mods into Bridge Commander. It
replaces the static indexes of Bridge Commander with dynamic
structures, thus providing the means for ship modders to easily
distribute their ships without overwriting any of the end user's
files.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Specifically,
the Foundation currently allows the following types of mods:</FONT></P>

	&ndash; A special Foundation concept, this allows you to replace an
	object or module inside the Python interpreter with another without
	having to overwrite any of the game's .py/.pyc files! An example is
	the intercept or planet-orbiting AI; this can now be replaced
	without overwriting stock files.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Mutators
	&ndash; Another special Foundation concept; it contains any number

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">You may
include statements to load sound effects ship plugin files or indeed
any file you load along with the ship. You can even use it to make
drop-in replacements for sound effects without replacing the stock
sounds. You need only include a line like the following:</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Foundation.SoundDef(&quot;sfx/Weapons/Klingon
Torp.wav&quot;, &quot;Klingon Plasma Torpedo&quot;, 1.0)</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">The
first argument in double quotes specifies the file, the second gives
you a name to refer to this sound by from inside the ship's
hardpoints, and the third is a volume adjuster, 1.0 being the normal
level.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><B>Packaging
a system</B></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Adding
a new system is relatively easy. You need only make a .py file in
scripts\Custom\Autoload named after the system you're adding. Its
contents should look like this:</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>import
Foundation<BR><BR>Foundation.SystemDef('New System', 3)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">This
will set things up for a new system with three planets. Systems
without planets can get by with 0 planets; systems like Vesuvi which
have missing inner planets get defined in this manner:</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>import
Foundation<BR><BR>Foundation.SystemDef('New System', 5, 2)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">This

a TGL</B></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">This
is fairly simple. Look at the following example:</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>Foundation.TGLDef('FTB
Ships', 'data/TGL/FTBShips.TGL')</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">The
first argument is a simple name for the TGL, the second is the
path/filename to be used. See QuickBattle.py if you want to see how
this is being loaded/unloaded.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><B>Packaging
an Override</B></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">This
procedure is not for the novice, but it does allow the intermediate
to advanced Bridge Commander modder a way to replace the game's code
without overwriting it. While it may not always work with some setups
of GUI events, cases where an object or module is all that need be
replaced should be doable. This is a bleeding-edge feature that
requires some knowledge of Python to know how to package the
replacements properly. However, getting the Foundation to play its
part is simple, as seen in this example from the author's Intercept
AI plugin:</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>import
Foundation</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">Foundation.OverrideDef('Intercept_Dasher',
'AI.PlainAI.Intercept.Intercept',
'<A HREF="http://AI.PlainAI.Intercept/">AI.PlainAI.Intercept</A>_Dasher.Intercept_Dasher'
} )</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
override is actually activated by calling the override's Activate()
function, i.e. interceptoverride.Activate(), and deactivated by &ndash;
you guessed it &ndash; Deactivate(), which puts the overriden Python
object back in place.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Packaging
a Mutator</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">This
procedure is not for the novice either! Any SoundDef, ShipDef,
SystemDef, or OverrideDef can have, as a final argument to its
constructor, a dictionary as an argument, which is surprisingly
enough named &ldquo;dict&rdquo;. Here's a version of the example of
an Override that packages two Overrides inside a single Mutator.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>import
Foundation</FONT></FONT></P>

)</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Note
that mutators are loaded in the order that they are defined inside
the Python interpreter. If you want detailed control of what mutator
takes precedence over another, I recommend the use of Nanobyte's Mod
Packager, version 3.0 or higher.<BR>Currently, the Foundation's
version of QuickBattle builds a temporary mutator that copies all
active mutators into a single object to provide a &ldquo;master
control&rdquo;. See QuickBattle.py for details on the useage of
Foundation.BuildGameMode().</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">It
is good form to call a Mutator's Activate() method when initializing
a game that uses it and the Deactivate() method when the game is
being terminated. This essentially calls the related methods of all
contained overrides.</FONT></P>
