<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">
This is
a fix for the Foundation 20020530 release, and for the bridges
released thus far by DreamArts Production.  It functions as a
plugin, yet will not install itself into future Foundation releases
that will not require it.  It includes all files necessary to
make all of the released original bridges, excluding retextures,
known to be released as of this writing.

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4><B>WHY DO I NEED THIS?</B></FONT></FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">
If you have installed bridges from multiple authors, you may well
have seen issues with crew placement in one bridge after installing another.
This is because previously, the Foundation
has not extended its plugin architecture to bridges, forcing bridge
authors to overwrite each other's code.  This goes against the philosophy of the
Foundation:  each mod author should be able to have their mods install
into a single installation of Bridge Commander without conflicts with
material from Totally Games or other mod authors.  This fix is being
released for redistribution with future bridges.

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4><B>HOW DO I INSTALL IT?</B></FONT></FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">
Just copy it in to your Bridge Commander folder!  You'll want to look at your scripts\Custom\Autoload folder and remove .py files
related to bridges you don't have.
