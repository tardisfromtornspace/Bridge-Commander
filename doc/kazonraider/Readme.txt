Here you go guys, may I present the Kazon Raider from Voyager. A few of you guys have been waiting for this so I put this one ahead of the other models in production. Have to say the model has been a real biatch to do and is the most complex mesh I've done yet.......so no complaining!! It is not as detailed as it should be because of the poly count so a lot of details have been applied to the texture instead. As another note, this does not feature any NFX2 lights as I never recall this ship having nav lights.

This will be converted to SFC - thanks DarkDrone ;)

Note this has been balanced against WTR's Intrepid, not the p81 version although it is intended to be quite weak.

Weapons:
2 forward disruptors
2 dorsal disruptors
2 ventral disruptors
1 aft disruptor
1 forward torpedo launchers
1 aft torpedo launcher
 
4 maps at 512x512 pixels, speculars included.

Installation:
//Latest Foundation plug-in needed
1.Unzip contents into a new folder and copy the 'Data', 'Scripts' & 'sfx' folders into your Bridge Commander root directory. If asked to overwrite files, click yes to all. This ship will NOT replace any ship installed.
2.Use Bridge Commander Mod Packager to import the ship.
3.Enjoy.

Bugs:
none
