DESCRIPTION
-----------
This mod will add gravity effects to BC (honestly, what kind of space simulation game doesn’t have gravity?), and of course other nice features. As their list is kinda big, and I need to explain them, let’s just jump to the list of some of the features of the mod:
	-Makes Planets and Suns in the game generate an gravity well, which will pull ships whithin it's radius.
	-Includes the set called "Psi's Blackhole", which contains a blackhole.
	-Has an menu in UMM to set some options of GravityFX.
	-Can make torpedoes create an gravity well upon impact, with the use of plugins.
	-Can make ships have an gravity well, if they have an gravity generator subsystem.
	-Can also make ships not to be affected by any gravity well, with the use of plugins.
	-Includes the System Map, which is a window opened in the science forum, that shows a map of the surrondings of the player, including planets, ships, etc.
	-Includes another menu in science called "Gravity Sensors Menu", which shows gravity-related info about ships, and also has some other features.
	-Includes a menu in enginnering called "Gravity Generator Options" which shows the status of the player's ship gravity generators, allowing you to change the power of them aswell.
	-Can show information about some objects on the BC 3D map.

And some other options and features, covered deeper in following topics on this readme.
