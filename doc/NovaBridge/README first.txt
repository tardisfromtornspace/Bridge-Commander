DESCRIPTION
-------------

Nova Class bridge (Uss Equinox and Uss Rhode Island) as seen in ST Voyager.   I have tried to model and texture it as closely as possible to screencaps so any errors or oversights will be due to lack of detailed visual information and making best use of existing materials.

Like the original bridge in Voyager, this is a revamp/refit of 3rd Era's original Prometheus bridge, with new textures, LCARS, lightmaps and revisions with command chairs and base from 3rd Era's Intrepid bridge.   


CREDITS
--------

Original Nova bridge design : Paramount Studios
Original Prometheus and Intrepid mesh and scripting :  3rd Era

Special thanks to 3rd Era and all at the BCC community for their encouragement and support (especially JimmyB, Baz, Nero, Bones, tiqhud and Barihawk).   And a special final thanks to all the beta testers :)
