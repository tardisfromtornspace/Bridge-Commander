Title : Runabout Bridges
Filename : RunaboutBridges1.5.zip
Version : 1.5

DESCRIPTION
-------------

Runabout shuttle bridges as seen in DS9. Although a revamp of BR32 TypeIX Bridge rather than a whole new mesh, I have tried to remodel and texture the two bridges as closely to screencaps where possible. 

Comes in two versions which can be installed as separate bridges:

1. Late seasons version with tactical standing floor console and transporter room at rear. 
2. Early seasons version with transporter in main cabin. 

Full crew will install by default, with Saffi/XO off-bridge but accessible via F3 key.  There are alternative scripts and anims if you just want a two-man version (player and Kiska) and crew off-bridge. Don't forget to backup original scripts before making any replacements. 

Bridges have animated consoles and red alert lights.

Technical Details
-----------------
Tested with BC version 1.1 with Kobayashi Maru 1.0.  Should work on non-KM mods.  


Known Bugs
----------
Usual shuttle bugs: possible screen distortion if too close to viewscreen, silent off-bridge Saffi. 
If transport to another bridge from silent-crew mode, new bridge will also be silent.  No fix at present. 

Please report any additional bugs and feedback to Lurok91 via BCC.
