 Wicked Zombie's / Zambie Zan's  Andromedans (Feb 27, 2026) for Star Trek Bridge Commander
 
 
The Andromedan Invaders – Ship Pack for Star Trek: Bridge Commander

This mod introduces 11 new Andromedan starships into Star Trek: Bridge Commander, bringing one of the most mysterious and technologically advanced factions in Star Trek gaming history to life.

Originally conceived for the tabletop strategy game Star Fleet Battles and later adapted to the PC classic Starfleet Command, the Andromedans are extragalactic invaders unlike any power in the Alpha Quadrant. Their ships do not rely on conventional shield systems or warp mechanics, instead utilizing power absorber panels, devastating high energy phasers and fearsome Tractor-Repulsor beam weaponry.

This pack faithfully recreates the distinct Andromedan aesthetic and combat philosophy within Star Trek: Bridge Commander, featuring:

- 11 fully playable Andromedan vessels

- Authentic weapons inspired by Star Fleet Battles lore

- Unique energy absorption mechanics


The Andromedans do not conquer, they eradicate resistance with surgical precision.

Against them you can't prevail - you just choose how you die.
