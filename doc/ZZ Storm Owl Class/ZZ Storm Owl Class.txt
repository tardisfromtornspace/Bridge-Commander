 Zambie Zan's Storm Owl Class v1.0 and Romulan Mine v1.0 (Jan 07, 2026) for Star Trek Bridge Commander
 
 
 The Storm Owl class Bird-of-Prey was a short lived but highly influential Romulan warship design. Developed in the late 23rd century as part of a new rapid escalation doctrine it was larger and more heavily armored than earlier Birds-of-Prey, yet far more agile than later Romulan warbirds. The Storm Owl represented a transitional step in Romulan naval evolution to counter the superior Excelsior Class and the recently developed Commodore Class. It mounted enhanced beams, disruptors, plasma torpedo arrays and devastating singularity mines that caused the catastrophic destruction of a Federation outpost. The prototype IRW T'Vrel, led the vanguard in the Tomed Incident of 2311 but the Treaty of Algeron that followed condemned the class to obscurity. Deemed too provocative, the vessels were decommissioned lest they shatter the fragile peace.
