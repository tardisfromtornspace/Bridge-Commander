This is a mod itended to make BC feel a bit like Klingon Academy.

My credit goes just on selecting proper moments for the files and renaming them. 

The hole rest goes to Inon Zur, composer of this kinda good music.

If you use this with Klingon Defense Force Mod it will make you fell almost in KA. 

It do not alter all the episodes music (with the bugs on fed people face on KDF you'll not want to), but you MUST do a backup of your sfx/music folder, in case you don't like it.

I´m puting it in 4 files that will make easy to download on low speeds (aprox 6 Mb each).

Any comments e-mail me at awatenor@ibest.com.br

To come: The Monitor (defiant class). The one used in Shatner´s The Return.
It has some good hiden cards for the player; and some new torp.
