Description	: Though is not Star Trek Canon, I made this as a choice. For those who want to 
                                      see a Terraformed Mars.  The Federation has the technology to accomplish this.
                                      I didn't add vegetation. It's still the "Red Planet" after all.
                                  
                                      This is compatable with Dasher42's Sol System Map.
