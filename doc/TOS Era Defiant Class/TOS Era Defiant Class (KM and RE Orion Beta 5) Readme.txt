TOS Defiant Concept for Bridge Commander Kobayashi Maru and Remastered v1.2/Orion Beta 5
Design: Interstellar Machine

Conversion to Bridge Commander by MSR1701
Hardpointing by MSR1701

Named after the ill fated Constitution Class Defiant which drifted out of phase with reality, this Defiant employs a controlled variation of this effect thanks to a mysterious alien technology. This may be the answer to the question of what happened to the cloaking device confistacted from the Romulan Battlecruiser by the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise at the height of the Klingon-Romulan Alliance early in the twenty-third century. (CL)
