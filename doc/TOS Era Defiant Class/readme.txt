Defiant TOS Prototype

S H I P   I N F O R M A T I O N

Named after the ill fated Constitution Class Defiant which drifted out of phase with reality, this Defiant employs a controlled variation of this effect thanks to a mysterious alien technology. This may be the answer to the question of what happened to the cloaking device confistacted from the Romulan Battlecruiser by the crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise at the height of the Klingon-Romulan Alliance early in the twenty-third century. (CL)

I had in mind to try this ship for a while. I had never been completely satisfied with the TOS Defiants out there. It seemed that most out there started with a TNG Defiant and then tried to retroize it. In this case, I have designed an entirely new model and tried to fit it together into a Defiant shape with some success.

PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, if you are a new modeller, DO use parts of my model to learn how to build some sweet looking ships. You don't even 
have to ask my permission.

Star Trek: Starfleet Command II: Empires at War / Star Trek: Starfleet Command: Orion Pirates:

Installing this add-on is a function of your own risk. If it messes up the game, I will take no responsibility, such are the 
perils of modding. Unzip zip file into . . .Assets/Models folder in your main Starfleet Command directory. Access 
shiplist.txt from the . . .Assets/Specs folder with a spreadsheet program (an ASCII reading program will also work). Make a 
backup of this file. Scroll through the ship listings until you find the ship you would like this ship to act like, copy the 
line, and paste it below as a new entry. In the new entry line, change the “Class” to something distinct and change the 
“Geometry” to “assets/models/tosdefiant/tosdefiant.mod”. Save the file. Your new ship will be accessed through the shipyard while in the 
game. If you have any questions or comments, my e-mail is interstellarmachine@hotmail.com

Star Trek Starfleet Command III The Next Generation:

Installing this add-on is a function of your own risk. If it messes up the game, I will take no responsibility, such are the 
perils of modding. Unzip zip file into . . .Assets/Models folder in your main Starfleet Command directory. Copy customLoadOut.txt from the tosdefiant folder into . . .Assets/Specs folder. This will overwrite any custom ships you may have in the game, if you do not want to do this, make a backup copy of the original. The TOS Defiant will appear as a variant of the Defiant Class in single player skirmish. If you have any questions or comments, my e-mail is interstellarmachine@hotmail.com

Interstellar Machine Corporation wants you to know that we have committed our lives to Jesus. You see, He made everything 
there is, including us. He loves us but, there is a problem. The wrong each of us has done separates us from Him and condemns 
us to death and hell. The bad news is there is no good things WE can do to be right with Him again. But, The good news is 
that He loves us anyway and died for those things for which we deserved to die in our place. Because of His power, He was 
able to overcome death and live again. We can share eternity and a close friendship with Him forever if we will only accept 
and trust in Him to rescue us and allow him to guide our lives. If you want to know more please email
