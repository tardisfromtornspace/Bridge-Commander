050102:
- Added Launcher, LauncherGroup, and LauncherManager
- Carriers now contain Launchers and/or LauncherGroups instead of containing "ships"
- LauncherGroups contain arbitrary sets of Launchers.
- Launchers require *TWO* hardpoints (important for future releases):
	-> an ObjectEmitterProperty named "<launcher name> OEP"
	-> a HullSubsystem named "<launcher name>"
	NOTE: It would be wise to have both subsystems colocated at the same XYZ coordinate on the ship
- For each Launcher/LauncherGroup, a "Launcher #" and "Type: #" button pair is generated in the GUI

050502a:
- User-definable AIs may be specified on a per ship type basis
- Launched objects are optionally commandable on a per ship type basis

051102a:
- Carriers are now "plugins" defined in /scripts/Custom/Carriers.
  See the included /scripts/Custom/Carriers/Dauntless.py for an example.  There have been some changes to Carrier
  modules since 050502a.

051102b:
- Fixed a bug introduced in 051102a where a Launcher can launch more ships than it contains.
