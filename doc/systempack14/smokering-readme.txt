This is a modification of the original game Star Trek:Bridge Commander by 
Totally Games and Activision. Neither party has authorized this mod, and therefore 
bear no responsibility to any affect it may have on the game.  Buyer Beware!

This particular set is to install the Smoke Ring as a new location in QuickBattle 
mode.  It is a high-end design, so low-end users may need to tweak their 
configurations for best results. This system is part of the Star Systems series of 
custom system maps. The other series are the Arenas and the Legends.

INSTALLATION:
Unzip into your Bridge Commander program folder, being sure to keep the 
directory structure intact. When you next start Bridge Commander, immediately 
go to "Configure," BEFORE you choose Quick Battle. Under the heading for 
"Mutators" there should now be an option for "BanzaiZAP SystemPack."

To play in any new system, simply start up Bridge Commander, and start a 
new Quick Battle. In the available systems, there should now be all new 
systems in the list. These new Star Systems are made for exploration and 
locations for Quick Battles. Interesting sights and unusual stellar combinations 
encourage Galactic Tourism and stimulates the galactic economy.

SYSTEM NOTES
The tiny star has captured enough matter to form a gaseous ring. There is no 
inherent gravity, but there are tides, which allows for interesting development. 
Long range scan has shown a forming atmosphere similar to that of a class-M 
planet with organic content.  It is of varying density and will quickly erode shields.  
It won't do additional hull damage, but it will make hull repairs impossible while 
inside the cloud. This makes for an interesting battle location.
The Smoke Ring:
Sun - White dwarf
Gas torus circling star

This system is from Larry Niven, a contemporary science-fiction writer. He has 
given NO permission whatsoever, but I hope he doesn't mind. There are 
currently no Integral Trees, but as soon as someone makes the mesh I will add 
them in!

I have left the Pythons uncompiled, so others can use this as a template to 
modify.  More advanced systems are forthcoming, including orbiting 
stations, etc. 
Have fun!
