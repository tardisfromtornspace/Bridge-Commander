This is a modification of the original game Star Trek:Bridge Commander by 
Totally Games and Activision. Neither party has authorized this mod, and therefore 
bear no responsibility to any affect it may have on the game.  Buyer Beware!

This particular set is to install the Battle Arena A as a new location in QuickBattle 
mode.  It is a high-end design, so low-end users may need to tweak their 
configurations for best results. This system is part of the Arenas series of 
custom system maps. The other series are the Star Systems and the Legends.

INSTALLATION:
Unzip into your Bridge Commander program folder, being sure to keep the 
directory structure intact. When you next start Bridge Commander, immediately 
go to "Configure," BEFORE you choose Quick Battle. Under the heading for 
"Mutators" there should now be an option for "BanzaiZAP SystemPack."

To play in any new system, simply start up Bridge Commander, and start a 
new Quick Battle. In the available systems, there should now be all new 
systems in the list. These Battle Arenas were expressly made as locations for 
battles, with places to run to (tell helm to Orbit Planet, or Intercept a Target), lay 
ambushes, etc.  

SYSTEM NOTES
The lighting got screwed up, so be alert for future fixes.  Still fun to play in, 
though. Nav Points, Planets and Targetables make for easy navigation, and 
a variety of environments to ambush people in. Forthcoming update will add 
AI to the Starbases.
Battle Arena A:
Sun - Medium-sized Yellow star (w/Nav Point)
Many Orbits - Gas giant with a numer of moons
Cloud of Stones - Rocky planet amidst an asteroid field
Mushroom - Federation starbase
Sand Dollar - Cardassion Starbase
Red Dwarf -  Dwarf star (w/Nav point) with large corona
Fallback Point - A Nav point away from the rest of combat

I have left the Pythons uncompiled, so others can use this as a template to 
modify.  More advanced systems are forthcoming, including orbiting 
stations, etc. 
Have fun!
