This is a modification of the original game Star Trek:Bridge Commander by 
Totally Games and Activision. Neither party has authorized this mod, and therefore 
bear no responsibility to any affect it may have on the game.  Buyer Beware!

This particular set is to install the BriarPatch as a new location in QuickBattle 
mode.  It is a high-end design, so low-end users may need to tweak their 
configurations for best results. This system is part of the Star Systems series of 
custom system maps. The other series are the Arenas and the Legends. This 
particular system also includes a new nebula background for the starsphere.

INSTALLATION:
Unzip into your Bridge Commander program folder, being sure to keep the 
directory structure intact. When you next start Bridge Commander, immediately 
go to "Configure," BEFORE you choose Quick Battle. Under the heading for 
"Mutators" there should now be an option for "BanzaiZAP SystemPack."

To play in any new system, simply start up Bridge Commander, and start a 
new Quick Battle. In the available systems, there should now be all new 
systems in the list. These Battle Arenas were expressly made as locations for 
battles, with places to run to (tell helm to Orbit Planet, or Intercept a Target), lay 
ambushes, etc.  

SYSTEM NOTES
This system was seen in the movie Star Trek: Insurrection. There are large 
nebula clouds (with a few hot spots) and a ringed planet tucked away in a 
clearing. The rings around this planet are of a strange metaphasic energy, and 
should not be touched. This system has a few points of interest, and includes one 
new background image.

Briar Patch:
Ringed Planet - Nice place. Do not touch the rings!
Hazard Beacon - Hot spot within the nebula

Special thanks to the following:
Saturn: Mesh by Redragon.  Textures a synthesis of work by Bj”rn J¢nsson and by 
Don Davis of JPL/Caltech. Providing source, Dasher42. Kudos to them!

I have left the Pythons uncompiled, so others can use this as a template to 
modify.  More advanced systems are forthcoming, including orbiting 
stations, etc. 
Have fun!
