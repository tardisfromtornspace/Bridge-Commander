This is a modification of the original game Star Trek:Bridge Commander by 
Totally Games and Activision. Neither party has authorized this mod, and therefore 
bear no responsibility to any affect it may have on the game.  Buyer Beware!

This particular set is to install the The Galaxy Set as a new location in QuickBattle 
mode.  It is a high-end design, so low-end users may need to tweak their 
configurations for best results. This system is part of the Star Systems series of 
custom system maps. The other series are the Arenas and the Legends.

INSTALLATION:
Unzip into your Bridge Commander program folder, being sure to keep the 
directory structure intact. When you next start Bridge Commander, immediately 
go to "Configure," BEFORE you choose Quick Battle. Under the heading for 
"Mutators" there should now be an option for "BanzaiZAP SystemPack."

To play in any new system, simply start up Bridge Commander, and start a 
new Quick Battle. In the available systems, there should now be all new 
systems in the list. These new Star Systems are made for exploration and 
locations for Quick Battles. Interesting sights and unusual stellar combinations 
encourage TheGalaxy Tourism and stimulates the TheGalaxy economy.

SYSTEM NOTES
Several warp points, many of them are populated. Feel free to explore.

The Galaxy:
One: Galactic Core, a dense cluster of stars
Two: Earth, with orbiting stations, Moon and ground targets.
Three: Vulcan, with targetable location.
Four: Kronos, with moons, stations and ground targets.
Five: Romulus, with stations, system and ground targets
Six: The Rim of the galaxy.
Seven: Intergalactic Space, where its very dark.

I have left the Pythons uncompiled, so others can use this as a template to 
modify.  More advanced systems are forthcoming, including orbiting 
stations, etc. 
Have fun!
