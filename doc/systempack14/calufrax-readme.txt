This is a modification of the original game Star Trek:Bridge Commander by 
Totally Games and Activision. Neither party has authorized this mod, and therefore 
bear no responsibility to any affect it may have on the game.  Buyer Beware!

This particular set is to install the Calufrax System as a new location in QuickBattle 
mode.  It is a high-end design, so low-end users may need to tweak their 
configurations for best results. This system is part of the Star Systems series of 
custom system maps.  These new systems are very small files, so future 
SystemPacks will include updated version of previous systems. The other series 
are the Arenas and the Legends.

INSTALLATION:
Unzip into your Bridge Commander program folder, being sure to keep the 
directory structure intact. When you next start Bridge Commander, immediately 
go to "Configure," BEFORE you choose Quick Battle. Under the heading for 
"Mutators" there should now be an option for "CalufraxZAP SystemPack."

To play in any new system, simply start up Bridge Commander, and start a 
new Quick Battle. In the available systems, there should now be all new 
systems in the list. These new Star Systems are made for exploration and 
locations for Quick Battles. Interesting sights and unusual stellar combinations 
encourage Galactic Tourism and stimulates the galactic economy.

SYSTEM NOTES
This is the first Ode to Doctor Who, and only you, the readers of this text-file, will 
ever know that! It includes a streamer of gas connecting the giant and the dwarf.
So sit back and explore. Have fun!

Calufrax System:
Trinary star system- red giant, purple dwarf and brown companion.
Calufrax 1 - burnt rock at the edge of the stellar coronas, good view
Calufrax 2 - habitable  world with three rocky moons
Calufrax 3 - Gas giant in far orbit with frozen moon

I have left the Pythons uncompiled, so others can use this as a template to 
modify.  More advanced systems are forthcoming, including orbiting 
stations, etc. 
Have fun!
