This is a modification of the original game Star Trek:Bridge Commander by Totally Games and Activision. Neither party has authorized this mod, and therefore bear no responsibility to any affect it may have on the game.  Buyer Beware!

This particular set is to install Universe as a new location in QuickBattle mode.  It is a high-end design, so low-end users may need to tweak their configurations for best results. This system is part of the Tourism series of custom system maps. The other series are the Arenas and the Legends.

INSTALLATION:
Unzip into your Bridge Commander program folder, being sure to keep the directory structure intact. When you next start Bridge Commander, immediately go to "Configure," BEFORE you choose Quick Battle. Under the heading for "Mutators" there should now be an option for "BanzaiZAP SystemPack."

To play in any new system, simply start up Bridge Commander, and start a new Quick Battle. In the available systems, there should now be all new systems in the list. This map was made to encourge captains to explore the Universe.

SYSTEM NOTES
This is one huge map with many locations. It works well for multiplayer, and is a blast to just fly around and explore a self-contained galaxy. It is not to scale, and it has a great many location, not all of which have nav points. We reccomend that you download and install Dasher42's Intercept, or RidgeDweller's Super Intercept, which eneables you to target stars!

Universe 1 is for single player, and has more objects spread further apart.
Universe 2 is for multiplayer, and has fewer objects, more nav points, and brings everything a bit closer together.

Warp-Speed Wobble is due to the extremely large distances between stars. It is harmless, and does not interfere with targeting in any way. You'll know what this means when you encounter it.

I have left the Pythons uncompiled, so others can use this as a template to modify.  More advanced systems are forthcoming, including orbiting stations, etc. 
Have fun!
