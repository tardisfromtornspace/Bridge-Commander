This is a modification of the original game Star Trek:Bridge Commander by 
Totally Games and Activision. Neither party has authorized this mod, and therefore 
bear no responsibility to any affect it may have on the game.  Buyer Beware!

This particular set is to install the Rainbow as a new location in QuickBattle 
mode.  It is a high-end design, so low-end users may need to tweak their 
configurations for best results. This system is part of the Star Systems series of 
custom system maps. The other series are the Arenas and the Legends.

INSTALLATION:
Unzip into your Bridge Commander program folder, being sure to keep the 
directory structure intact. When you next start Bridge Commander, immediately 
go to "Configure," BEFORE you choose Quick Battle. Under the heading for 
"Mutators" there should now be an option for "BanzaiZAP SystemPack."

To play in any new system, simply start up Bridge Commander, and start a 
new Quick Battle. In the available systems, there should now be all new 
systems in the list. These Battle Arenas were expressly made as locations for 
battles, with places to run to (tell helm to Orbit Planet, or Intercept a Target), lay 
ambushes, etc.  

SYSTEM NOTES
This is an exotic star being studied by the Vulcans, and colonized by the 
Federation. The star itself has unique properties, in that it's atmosphere is 
divided into specific layers, each with its own color. In orbit are a habital planet, 
and a gas giant. The system has three warp locations. The first is far out system. 
The second is in high orbit around the gas giant. Pilots can skim through the 
upper atmosphere. The third warp point is in close orbit around the exotic sun. 

Rainbow System:
Sun - Exotic star that has iridescent radiation due to odd gasses in its locale.
Near Stars - Nav Point near the star. Fly through its corona to see layers.
Odin - Gas giant with flyable atmosphere.
Thought - Desert moon in lower orbit
Memory - Rocky moon in high orbit
Odin Dark Side - Nav Point on the dark side of Odin, away from the star.

I have left the Pythons uncompiled, so others can use this as a template to 
modify.  More advanced systems are forthcoming, including orbiting 
stations, etc. 
Have fun!
