This is a modification of the original game Star Trek:Bridge Commander by 
Totally Games and Activision. Neither party has authorized this mod, and therefore 
bear no responsibility to any affect it may have on the game.  Buyer Beware!

This particular set is to install Wolf 359 as a new location in QuickBattle 
mode.  It is a high-end design, so low-end users may need to tweak their 
configurations for best results. This system is part of the Legends series of 
custom system maps. The other series are the Star Systems and the Battle 
Arenas.

INSTALLATION:
Unzip into your Bridge Commander program folder, being sure to keep the 
directory structure intact. When you next start Bridge Commander, immediately 
go to "Configure," BEFORE you choose Quick Battle. Under the heading for 
"Mutators" there should now be an option for "BanzaiZAP SystemPack."

To play in any new system, simply start up Bridge Commander, and start a 
new Quick Battle. In the available systems, there should now be all new 
systems in the list. These Battle Arenas were expressly made as locations for 
battles, with places to run to (tell helm to Orbit Planet, or Intercept a Target), lay 
ambushes, etc.  

SYSTEM NOTES
This is the location where Starfllet met a Borg Cube head-on in the TNG episode:
Best of Both Worlds, and the DS9 episode:The Emissary. Starfleet got its 
collective butt kicked. When you come warping in, the battle has already been 
joined, so there are damaged and destroyed Federation craft drifting around the 
system. Mind you don't run into them!

KNOWN BUG: Sometimes, when you arrive in system, the derilect ships may not 
appear. Simply load in another system, then reload Wolf 359, and the wrecks should 
be drifting in the battlefield. Another possible solution is to reset your graphic details 
to Medium.

Wolf 359:
Sun - Distant white star 
BattleSite - Nav Point in the middle of the wrecked ships
There are more than a dozen wrecked ships in this system.  Even though there are 
not many planetary objects, the detailed wrecks make this system a processor hog!

I have left the Pythons uncompiled, so others can use this as a template to 
modify.  More advanced systems are forthcoming, including orbiting 
stations, etc. 
Have fun!
