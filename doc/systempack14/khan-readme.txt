This is a modification of the original game Star Trek:Bridge Commander by 
Totally Games and Activision. Neither party has authorized this mod, and therefore 
bear no responsibility to any affect it may have on the game.  Buyer Beware!

This particular set is to install the Khan as a new location in QuickBattle 
mode.  It is a high-end design, so low-end users may need to tweak their 
configurations for best results. This system is part of the Legends series of 
custom system maps. The other series are the Arenas and Star Systems.

INSTALLATION:
Unzip into your Bridge Commander program folder, being sure to keep the 
directory structure intact. When you next start Bridge Commander, immediately 
go to "Configure," BEFORE you choose Quick Battle. Under the heading for 
"Mutators" there should now be an option for "BanzaiZAP SystemPack."

To play in any new system, simply start up Bridge Commander, and start a 
new Quick Battle. In the available systems, there should now be all new 
systems in the list. This Legendary Systems is for both exploration, and 
as a site for battles.  Nav Points and longer distances make for some 
cinematic warp-speed chases.

SYSTEM NOTES
This system was epressly made to replicate the battles from the movie 
Star Trek II:The Wrath of Khan. It has places to run to, planetary objects, and, 
of course, the Mutara Nebula. This nebula will take down shields fairly quickly, 
but not do much in the way of hull damage. This system is best seen with the 
Constitution and Miranda class ships.
Wrath of Khan:
Regula  - Large orange star
Regula 1  - Dead, rocky planet circling in far orbit.
Regula Science Facility - Research station home of the Genesis Project.
Mutara Nebula Entry - Nav Point at the near edge of the Nebula
Mutara Nebula Center - Nav Point in the heart of the Nebula
Mutara Nebula Center - Nav Point at the far side of the Nebula
Vantage Point - Nav Point above the plane of the system
Ceti Alpha - Small, distant red star
Ceti Alpha 1+ - Planets in far orbit.

I have left the Pythons uncompiled, so others can use this as a template to 
modify.  More advanced systems are forthcoming, including orbiting 
stations, etc. 
Have fun!
