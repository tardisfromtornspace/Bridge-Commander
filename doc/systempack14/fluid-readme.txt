This is a modification of the original game Star Trek:Bridge Commander by 
Totally Games and Activision. Neither party has authorized this mod, and therefore 
bear no responsibility to any affect it may have on the game.  Buyer Beware!

This particular set is to install Fluid as a new location in QuickBattle 
mode.  It is a high-end design, so low-end users may need to tweak their 
configurations for best results. This system is part of the Legends series of 
custom system maps. The other series are the Arenas and Star Systems.

INSTALLATION:
Unzip into your Bridge Commander program folder, being sure to keep the 
directory structure intact. When you next start Bridge Commander, immediately 
go to "Configure," BEFORE you choose Quick Battle. Under the heading for 
"Mutators" there should now be an option for "BanzaiZAP SystemPack."

To play in any new system, simply start up Bridge Commander, and start a 
new Quick Battle. In the available systems, there should now be all new 
systems in the list. This Legendary Systems is for both exploration, and 
as a site for battles.  Nav Points and longer distances make for some 
cinematic warp-speed chases.

SYSTEM NOTES
This system was made to simulate Fluidic Space as seen in Star Trek:
Voyager.  It has a new custom nebula-cloud texture to enhance the visuals.

Fluid:
Several scttered stars (one blue, one cyan, and one purple)

I have left the Pythons uncompiled, so others can use this as a template to 
modify.  More advanced systems are forthcoming, including orbiting 
stations, etc. 
Have fun!
