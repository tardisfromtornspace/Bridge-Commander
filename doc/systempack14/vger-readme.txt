This is a modification of the original game Star Trek:Bridge Commander by 
Totally Games and Activision. Neither party has authorized this mod, and therefore 
bear no responsibility to any affect it may have on the game.  Buyer Beware!

This particular set is to install the Vger system as a new location in QuickBattle 
mode.  It is a high-end design, so low-end users may need to tweak their 
configurations for best results. This system is part of the Legends series of 
custom system maps. The other series are the Arenas and the Star Systems.

INSTALLATION:
Unzip into your Bridge Commander program folder, being sure to keep the 
directory structure intact. When you next start Bridge Commander, immediately 
go to "Configure," BEFORE you choose Quick Battle. Under the heading for 
"Mutators" there should now be an option for "BanzaiZAP SystemPack."

To play in any new system, simply start up Bridge Commander, and start a 
new Quick Battle. In the available systems, there should now be all new 
systems in the list. These new Star Systems are made for exploration and 
locations for Quick Battles. Interesting sights and unusual stellar combinations 
encourage Galactic Tourism and stimulates the galactic economy.

SYSTEM NOTES
This system is made to simulate the Star Trek Motion Picture location. It is a 
glowing nebula that gets thicker the deeper you go, then it opens fire on you!
Perimeter Bouy: Nav point that marks the edge of the nebula.
Hazard Beacon: This makrs the edge of the danger zone.
Vger Core: the final central location where its very dark and dangerous.

I have left the Pythons uncompiled, so others can use this as a template to 
modify.  More advanced systems are forthcoming, including orbiting 
stations, etc. 
Have fun!
