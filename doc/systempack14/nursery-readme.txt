This is a modification of the original game Star Trek:Bridge Commander by 
Totally Games and Activision. Neither party has authorized this mod, and therefore 
bear no responsibility to any affect it may have on the game.  Buyer Beware!

This particular set is to install the Stellar Nursery as a new location in QuickBattle 
mode.  It is a high-end design, so low-end users may need to tweak their 
configurations for best results. This system is part of the Star Systems series of 
custom system maps. The other series are the Arenas and the Legends. This 
particular system also includes a new nebula background for the starsphere.

INSTALLATION:
Unzip into your Bridge Commander program folder, being sure to keep the 
directory structure intact. When you next start Bridge Commander, immediately 
go to "Configure," BEFORE you choose Quick Battle. Under the heading for 
"Mutators" there should now be an option for "BanzaiZAP SystemPack."

To play in any new system, simply start up Bridge Commander, and start a 
new Quick Battle. In the available systems, there should now be all new 
systems in the list. These Battle Arenas were expressly made as locations for 
battles, with places to run to (tell helm to Orbit Planet, or Intercept a Target), lay 
ambushes, etc.  

SYSTEM NOTES
This is a massive dust cloud, part of the Pillars of Creation in M-16. There are stars 
being formed in the heart of the pillar, and matter is beginning to precipitate in the 
middle of the column. The major portion of the formation is diffuse enough that 
sensors are not inhibited, though there are denser pockets. There is a hazard 
beacon warning ships away from an intensely hot and radioactive part of the cloud, 
which may destroy ships. 
Stellar Nursery:
Nursery Gate - Entry to the cloud, just outside of the main nebula.
Birthing Ground - Several small stars are forming near each other at the head of the cloud
Matter Condensation - dust is forming into small pockets of solid matter
Hazard Beacon - Marker beacon to warn ships away from this location.

I have left the Pythons uncompiled, so others can use this as a template to 
modify.  More advanced systems are forthcoming, including orbiting 
stations, etc. 
Have fun!
