This is a modification of the original game Star Trek:Bridge Commander by 
Totally Games and Activision. Neither party has authorized this mod, and therefore 
bear no responsibility to any affect it may have on the game.  Buyer Beware!

This particular set is to install the Junkyard as a new location in QuickBattle 
mode.  It is a high-end design, so low-end users may need to tweak their 
configurations for best results. This system is part of the Arenas series of 
custom system maps. The other series are the Star Systems and the Legends.

INSTALLATION:
Unzip into your Bridge Commander program folder, being sure to keep the 
directory structure intact. When you next start Bridge Commander, immediately 
go to "Configure," BEFORE you choose Quick Battle. Under the heading for 
"Mutators" there should now be an option for "BanzaiZAP SystemPack."

To play in any new system, simply start up Bridge Commander, and start a 
new Quick Battle. In the available systems, there should now be all new 
systems in the list. These Battle Arenas were expressly made as locations for 
battles, with places to run to (tell helm to Orbit Planet, or Intercept a Target), lay 
ambushes, etc.  

SYSTEM NOTES
Gessik the Scrap Merchant has been haunting battlezones for many years. 
He has accumulated a large number of old derelicts, which has made his junkyard 
a popular battle spot. Recent encounters have only added to his collection...
Because of the number of objects, this system may slow down low-end systems.
Junkyard Battle Arena:
Sun - Distant red-orange star 
Gessik's Castle - Gessik lives in a Cardassian Station off to one side of the yard
Farside Beacon - Nav Point to on the opposite side of the Junkyard
Outer Beacon - Nav Point below the Junkyard
There are about a dozen wrecked ships and some asteroids filling the junkyard.

I have left the Pythons uncompiled, so others can use this as a template to 
modify.  More advanced systems are forthcoming, including orbiting 
stations, etc. 
Have fun!
