All files included in this mod are necessary in order for
the AI's to function properly. Please take your time and 
view the changes made to each file that may cause conflicts 
between other mods. The changes made to each file included
in this mod should not conflict with any other mod that uses
the same file(s). So if there are any file(s) that uses the
same file(s) listed in this mod, simply copy and paste the
changes into the same file(s). I have left Readme notes of 
changes to each file that should clear up any problems that
you may run into.
