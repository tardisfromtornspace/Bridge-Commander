This file is necessary to assist in puting
speed restrictions on the Borg and should 
not conflict with any other file as this is
a new file. With the Borg now able to attack
numerous ships while moving, it would be
un-Borg-like for them to be moving around
like jack rabbits. But this has nothing to
do with them intercepting a target, so you
can run, but you can't hide:)
