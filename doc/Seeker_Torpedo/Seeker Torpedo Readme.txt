Seeker Torpedo 1.0

DESCRIPTION

This script will allow you to prepare a torpedo that will seek out impulse emissions from both cloaked and non-cloaked ships.  This is not a torpedo technology but will give the seeking capabilities to which ever torpedo is currently loaded in the tubes.  Ships or objects that either do not have impulse systems or the impulse system is powered down will not be tracked. This can be used as a counter measure against the weapon.  Be careful as the torpedo will not discriminate between enemies or friendlies and will lock on to the nearest ship's impulse emissions.  I wrote this script about a year ago.

How TO USE

In the Science Officers menu click the button labeled [ Prepare Seeker Torpedo ].  Science officer will acknowledge the command and will begin preparing the torpedo. Preparation will take 10 seconds at which time a button labeled [ Fire Seeker Torpedo ] will appear at the top of the Tactical Officer's menu.  Click this button and watch the torpedo home in on the target.
