	Author: Mark

	To Install: 

		Just run the exe and follow the instructions


	Description:

		This Mod replaces a lot of the stock interface colors with more "canon" colors. It also adds a new mouse cursor system
		which disables the mouse stretching which the stock game used to do between screen resolutions.
	
		This file will overwrite any other mouse cursor / target cursor modifications.
