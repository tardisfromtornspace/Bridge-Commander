<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>=^= -----Future Technologies Addition Ver 2.0----- =^=</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>--------------Description--------------</P>
<P>The Future Technologies Addition (FTA) is a collection of new script technologies that modders can use to make their ships and weapons do what they are supposed to do in the story line.</P>
<P>To install, just copy all the files and folders contained in this .zip file to your bridge commander root directory.</P>
<P>Requires: Defiant's QBAutostart Ver 0.6 or higher. (Be sure to activate the QBAutostart mutator ).</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>--------------Some examples of what can be done with FTA 2.0--------------</P>
<P>If you wanted to make the star trek undiscovered country's bird of prey, using FTA 2.0 you can make it actually fire torpedoes <U>while under cloak</U>.</P>
<P>If you wanted to do a chronoton torpedo (like on voyager), with FTA 2.0 you can make the torpedo actually pass <U>through shields</U> like the real thing, instead of making a standard torpedo that just does a bunch of damage.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Weapons included in FTA 2.0:</P>

<UL>
<LI>PoleronTorp.py --- This torpedo passes through shields and damages whatever subsystem you have it targeted at, without weakening the shields in the slightest </FONT><FONT FACE="Wingdings" SIZE=2>J</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. </LI>
<LI>RepulsionTorp.py --- This one violently repels the ship it hits at warp speed, and sends it spinning out of control…Mwhahahahaha. </LI>
<LI>HyperonTorp.py --- Drains all shields on the target by a percentage or a minimum value, whichever is greater. </LI>
<LI>ChronotonTorp.py --- Passes through shields, and damages a target's hull by a percentage or minimum value, whichever is greater.</LI></UL>

<P>All of the above weapon's .py files include instructions on how to change their parameters (e.g. damage, repulsion force etc.).</P>
<P>Improvements made since Ver 1.0:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Equipping a ship with the advanced armor has been made a lot simpler. </LI>
<LI>Ships with the armor activated will not incur any visual damage effects from weapon hits now. </LI>
<LI>The advanced armor now gives the ship designer the ability to set the strength of the armor. </LI>
<LI>Capability for ships to fire torpedoes while under cloak has been added. </LI>
<LI>New, fully functional special torpedoes have been added to this mod. </LI>
<LI>All of the core files have been enhanced and streamlined for performance. </LI>
<LI>FTA 2.0 is fully back compatible with Ver 1.0.</LI></UL>
