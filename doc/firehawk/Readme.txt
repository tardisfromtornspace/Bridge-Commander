This ship Turns, rolls and manuvers very well, and will pound you from every direction 
with a varity of weaponry. The battle will get uplcose and personal, as near collsions mean point blank
hit. Use your manuvering to eavde torpedos. When This ship is your enemy, tractor beam useage is essential,
as are making torpedo's count. Keep it's bow pointed away from you. The shield generator is above the shuttlebay
pod and is realatively easy to get if you go for the lower shield.
