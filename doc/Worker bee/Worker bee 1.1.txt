Worker bee 1.1 (By Uss Donoghue)


All you need to do is install this into a temp folder and copy the folders into
your Root BC directory e.g C:\Program Files\Activision\Bridge Commander.

Then use BCMP 3.1 or above to install the ship into your game.

I have made tractor beams a little more powerful than 1.0 and now your game shouldnt crash


The ship is also not a combat ship so it only has a few basic things but no weapons
part from tractors.
