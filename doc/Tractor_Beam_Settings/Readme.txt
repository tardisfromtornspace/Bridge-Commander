DESCRIPTION
___________

* A simple mod that changes Tractor Modes. There are four of them.
Everything depends on the MaxDamage of the tractor beam properties.
I tested it on two ships so far; one with 80 MaxDamage setting and one with
500 MaxDamage setting the results were noticable. I suggest setting Tractor 
Beams MaxDamage to about 400 to get noticable results. It's up to you.

* THE SETTINGS ARE:
1. Normal Tractor Mode, or default one that's comes in the game
2. Tow Mode, this mode actually drags the ship, it doesn't matter
how fast you go. Well from my tests I concluded this. Also it depends on your 
tractor beams MaxDamage.
3. Push Mode or Repulse Mode. It pushes the enemy away from you. Also
everything depends on the MaxDamage of your tractor beams.
4. Pull Mode it pulls the enemy close to you, it's like Repulse Mode only
in opposite direction. It's directed at you. Also it depends on tractor
beams MaxDamage.
