Promellian Asteroid System. This Does include the ships needed.
Do what Picard could not do. SAVE the Promellian. Look good in a museum.

And it will overwrite the SFRD_Promellian and the Quantar, if you have them. 
But their not required, cause their in this download.

NOTE : On some systems you might want to lower your, -time factor- in the Galaxy Charts configuration. 

read the readmes and especially the requirements.

====================================================================================================
==================================== Required ================================================================
you will need to have installed the bridge commander patch 
[ http://bridgecommander.filefront.com/file/Bridge_Commander_Patch;2374 ]

screenshots by beta testers, graphics quality is different because the screenshots are from different systems.

tested in Kobayashi Maru and with Starfleet R-D-s Enginerring Kit
and Gravity turned off [you mite want to do for some computer systems]

 the SFRD_Promellian appears in QB menu -SFRD Ships-
 the QuanTar is in QB menu -Other Ships-

Note:  really only Eye Candy, but can be a mission, on some Computer Systems you need to turn the Astroid -QuanTar-
 to enemy , even if it says it already.
Don-t forget to check the Mutator Promellian.
  
On some systems you might want to lower your, -time factor- in the Galaxy Charts configuration.
