Description of the Modification
-------------------------------

An original model created in 3dsmax by Rick Knox. Mesh modified in 3dsmax 4.1
by Scotchy with new high rez textures. Converted using SDK plugin for Max 3.1
Hardpointed by Thunderchild for maximum kickass, with canon torpedo sounds by
Book.

Based more on Akira Concepts than on the Voyager mesh from Star Trek magazine.

Technical Details
-----------------
Polycount        : 7500+
Textures         : (4) 1024x1024
                   (1) 512x512

Tested in Bridge Commander 1.0

Will replace your stock Akira (or any Akira in the Akira folder for that matter).

The Hardpoint is not too much different from the p81 hardpoint by laurelin
in it's sheild strenghts and shull strength. It has some ATP systems (ablative
armor, etc) and a canon torpedo armament. If you're not careful enough you could
expend all your torpedoes relatively quick; this thing has very little reload time.
Actually it's almost none, so it can launch a massive assault but to compensate
it has no rear armament and it's hull is still vulnerable enough to make it killable
by a couple of BOPs. If you don't like it, the original p81 HP should fit. 

Known Bugs
----------
Smoothing wierdness. Will fix in v2.0.

Steps to install
----------------

1. Extract all files directly into your C:\Program Files\Activision\Bridge Commander\

2. Use BCMP to add the ship to the game if necessary.
3. Play.
4. Ccomplain if you don't like it (email above, or post at BCU).
