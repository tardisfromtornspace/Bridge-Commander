Description of the Mod File
---------------------------

Galor and Keldon I originally built for SFCII/OP.


Installation:
-------------

WARNING!!!!!!!! (THESE TWO FILES WILL REPLACE THE ORIGINAL GALOR AND KELDON THAT CAME WITH BRIDGE COMMMANDER)  It will also replace if I am not mistaken 9 of 9's excellent version as well, so BACK UP your originally installed files.  Don't blame me if you didn't read this!

Unzip the files into a temp directory on your hard disk, copy the files to your root Star Trek Bridge Commander directory.
