How to install
=================================================================

1. Unzip all files
2. Highlight all files in the "C2steamrunner" folder
3. Drag and drop them into the main Bridge commander Folder
  * C:/program files/Activision/Bridge Commander *
4. Open BCMP
5. Check the ship to make sure all is correct and working by going to
   "game tools" then checker

6. If all is correct install but going to "Ship Plugin" and from the menu
on the right, click on "C2steamrunner.py and click "make plugin"

Problems?

I get this Q all the time. "I done everything you said in your readme, but
the ships isnt in the menu". Go to Options and in he "Mutator" menu in options 
turn all the modded and stock ships on etc... U NEED FOUNDATION AND BCMP (BRIDGE COMMANDER MOD PACKAGER) FOR THIS MOD
