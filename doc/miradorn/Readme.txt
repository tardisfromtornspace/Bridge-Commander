This is the Miradorn ship as featured the DS9 episode 'Vortex' as Arctus Baran's ship in the TNG 2 part episode 'Gambit', and as the Taresian ship from the VGR episode 'Favourite son'. 
This was specially made for the up-coming ATP Dimensions from USS Apollo. I designed the hardpoints to reflect this as a frontal assault vessel - though they may differ in ATP Dimensions purely at USS Apollo's discretion.
Weapons:
2 forward burst phasers
2 forward disruptors
2 forward torpedo launchers
1 Aft Torpedo launcher
 
3 maps at 512x512 pixels, speculars included.

Installation:
//Latest Foundation plug-in needed
//NanoFX2 needed for the blinker / nav lights
1.Unzip contents into a new folder and copy the 'Data', 'Scripts' & 'sfx' folders into your Bridge Commander root directory. If asked to overwrite files, click yes to all. This ship will NOT replace any ship installed.
2.Use Bridge Commander Mod Packager to import the ship.
3.Enjoy.

Bugs:
none
