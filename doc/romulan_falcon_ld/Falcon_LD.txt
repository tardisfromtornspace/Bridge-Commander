General Info
-------------------------------------
The Falcon is an advanced fast attack cruiser.
Although small in size it packs a powerful punch
and has incredible manuverability.  Because of
its tighly cut design it lacks any real hull area
to protect vital system behind. The more successful
Tribues make use of its manuverability and cloak
to stay out of direct lines of fire.
