for all previous versions of the construct mod


--==Description==--

Gives Objects (In most cases stations, i think) the abillity to construct new ships.


--==Requirements==--


Kobayashi Maru 0.9 or any higher version (tested with v1.0)

.NET Framework for the PluginCreator


--==Installation==--

Copy the scripts folder into your BC-Root Directory (Default: Program Files\Activision\Bridge Commander\)
If you want to use the included example install it the same way


--==How to give a base the abillity to launch ships?==--

I've included a PluginCreator witch is well documented.
This version is fully backwards compatible witch means you can use all of your plugins of version 0.2.


--==Canges in v4==--

Fixed bugs with creating more docks per Base.
Intelligent ship launching: you can specify at witch percentage of enemy presence in the set a ship will be launched.
Protection Shield: Bases can create a protective shield around the ship being created.
Force Start: You can force a ship to start immediately; if it has been repaired or not.
Waypoint defined leaving route: Ships can fly complex routes while undocking.
I think that was all.


--==Bugs / ToDo==--

Ships being able to return to a base after a fight --- maybe sometime
If there is anything please report it to me: <c.notsch AT gmx DOT at>. I'll fix it as soon as possible;


--==Sorry for==--
