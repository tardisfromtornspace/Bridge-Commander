The TG scripter Colin Carley.

I only have done what he has written (see Directory "BCU source")

...and fixed the bugs and errors out of it and added the possibility to Cancel the self Destruction.

Usage:
<---------->
Press your Keys for self Destruction (usally STRG+D) and the Countdown will be started.
Press the Keys again if you don't want to blow up your ship now:
The Destruction will be canceld and locked.
To restart the self Destruction you have to press STRG+D two times:
-One time for unlocking the Self Destruction and
-the 2nd time for initiating the Countdown.

The script is now compatible with the Transporter from the QBR.


Requirements:
<---------->
-The QBautostart Extension 0.5 or higher


Changes:
<---------->
Version 1.5:	Added compatibility for the new Version of the QBautostart Extension 
Version 1.4:	Added the Button to set the count time.
Version 1.3:	Added a Button for Self Destruction and the script is now working with the Transporter
Version 1.2:	Changed the Timing again - now I got the right Values (even I hope that).
Version 1.11b:	Changed the Timing.
Version 1.1b:	Added the possibility to cancel the Countdown and Saffi Command
Version 1.0:	First Release
