Klingon K'Tinga Class Battlecrusier


This mod combines the script files of P81's D7TOS v1.0 mod with the Data Files of Quantum's D7 v1.0
This also includes a unique Disruptor2.py file in \scripts\tactical\projectiles.
The creation of Disruptor2.py was of modifing MadJohn's Turbo Laser.py to emit a green pulse.


The Hardpoint file was modified by me; Wraithzero

Specifics
##########################################################################
This being my first ship, I wish to let you know that my definition of "Canon"
is what is Technical and what is observable.  

The K'Tinga is more/less a TMP era vessel.  It is armed with 8 Disruptor cannons,
2 Heavy Disruptors, and 2 Photon Torpedo Launchers,(armament you'd find on a K'Tinga
from Klingon Academy).  Placement is such that she can be defended from all sides.

The 8 disruptor cannons are the disruptor2.py file. They are smaller and do less damage, but fire rapidly
The 2 heavy disruptors are standards found on BC stock models; they have been modded to fire much slower.

Testing on the disruptor2 was found satisfactory, it competes well with TMP models.
Against TNG models; Anything that doesn't fire back can be destroyed.
