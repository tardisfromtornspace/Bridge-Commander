About-------------------------

This is the Enterprise as seen in Star Trek: Nemesis. This version features additional phaser arrays and photon torpedo tubes as well as a sleeker shuttlebay. The hull coloring is based from the onscreen CGI ship, and not the schematic colors which seem to be much darker. The ship features 2048-pixel resolution textures that bring out the detail in the intricate hull "aztec." This Enterprise also features an accurate hardpoint originally created by Jb06 with weapons and sounds from the movie. This version can launch the captain's yacht as seen in Star Trek: Insurrection.
