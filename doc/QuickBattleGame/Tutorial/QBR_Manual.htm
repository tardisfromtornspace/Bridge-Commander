<CENTER><B>Welcome to the QBR 2.14 tutorial</B><P>This tutorial will explain the 
workings of QuickBattle Replacement (QBR) from how to start the game to creating and saving your own 
QuickBattleGame configurations<P></CENTER><BR>

<HR><a name="START"></a><I><B>Getting 
Started</I></B><br><br>
<I><B>*** If you chose to install the optional
 main menu mod, you can skip this section ***</I></B><br>
<B>-------------- just start the game normally and the menu will appear as below --------------</B>
<P>The first thing to do is get the game to run in "TestMode". If you chose to install the optional
 main menu mod, you can skip this section.
You can do this by using the supplied shortcut in the Bridge Commander Start 
Menu group, or by creating your own shortcut.<BR><BR>If you want to create a 
shortcut manually, locate the "stbc.exe: file in your game directory (typically 
the path is C:\Program Files\Activision\Bridge Commander. Right click on this 
file and choose "Send to" and then choose "Desktop(create shortcut)". Then right 
click on the newly created shortcut (on your desktop) and change the text in the 
"Target" box to read:</P>
<CENTER>"C:Program Files\Activision\Bridge Commander\stbc.exe" 
-TestMode</CENTER><BR><BR>There must be ONE space at the end, a dash, then TestMode with 
a capital T and M in the word TestMode. You can also rename the shortcut by 
right clicking on it and selecting "rename".<BR><BR>Start the game from 
the supplied shortcut (located in the Bridge Commander Start Menu Folder or on the desktop) or with 
the one you may have just created.<BR><BR>The game will load normally and when the main menu appears, the 
quickbattle button will be replaced by "Missions" if you have opted to install 
the supplied MainMenu.py, or "Test Only" if you have not. <BR>Also notice that the 
regular old Quick Battle button is here as an option as well as jumps to the 
single player missions. You can go to regular quick battle from here without 
incedent - it will work as it always has. You can also go to any Single Player 
Mission. <BR><BR>But, right now to start the QBR game:
<BR>see fig 1: <BR><IMG 
height=450 alt="" src="QBR Manual_files/1.jpg" width=600 border=0> <BR>Click on 
the missions(test only) button, click Custom Missions, and select 
"QuickBattleGame". DO NOT select Autoload, Ships, or Carriers.<BR>
<BR>The game 
will then load, then you will find yourself on the bridge of an Sovereign class 
ship.<BR>
<BR>see fig 2:<BR><IMG height=450 
alt="" src="QBR Manual_files/2.jpg" width=600 border=0> <IMG height=450 alt="" 
src="QBR Manual_files/2A.jpg" width=600 border=0> 
<BR>The QuickBattleGame has 
now loaded in the default configuration. There has to be a default configuration 
in order for it to load. If you look around, you will find yourself floating in 
the Tevron II system with a friendly ship, the USS Constipation and a 
Federation Starbase. Have your Helm Officer hail the Constipation - click "hail" 
and watch the Constipation dock. You can issue orders to friendly ships 
through the hail command. Since there aren't any enemy ships in the system, 
right now you can only order them to dock (by just hailing them) or to protect 
you. Next, hail the Starbase and watch yourself dock. You can dock whenever you need repair 
or resupply. You can also order friendlies to dock for the same 
reason...<BR><BR>After you get tired of ordering the Constipation around and 
bugging the poor starbase commander, head off to Artrus system.You will 
arrive at Outpost 7. You cannot dock at outpost 7. The Constipation will follow 
you automatically (albeit kind off slowly - it's hard to get good help these 
days...)<BR><BR>Set a course for Artrus I. There you will find two Cardassian 
ships, the Bubblegum &amp; the Rogue. Now it's battle time, wipe them out. 
Remember you can order the Constipation around and warp back to Tevron II to 
repair if need be. Remember to go to Red Alert as each game starts you at green 
alert. <BR><BR>

<I><B>Advanced Features:<BR><BR></I></B>
<I><B>*** Fleet Hail:<BR></I></B>Access the fleet hail option under your helm menu.
 You can order the whole fleet to attack your target, or to resume their old orders.</B><BR><BR>
 <I><B>*** Emergency Transport:<BR></I></B>Access this from your engineer's console.
  You can transfer your crew to a freindly ship if your ship has had it or if you want
   to abandon your ship for some reason. Your crew will be transported to the friendly
    ship and leave yours floating in space. You will have limited control over your
	 guest ship (just be glad your still alive). From the guest ship, you can transfer
	  to another or back to your derelict ship. You must be within transporter range (ca. 50 km) for
	   this to work.</B><BR><BR>
<I><B>*** Shuttle Launching:<BR></I></B>The shuttle launching framework will now work in QBR - special thanks to Poddy for this. </B><BR><BR>

<I><B>Making Your Own Missions:<BR><BR></I></B>Now let us create 
our own new game configuration. Go to your first officer and click 
configure.<BR>
<BR>fig 3:<BR><IMG height=450 alt="" src="QBR Manual_files/3.jpg" 
width=600 border=0> <BR>The QBR editing screen will open. Here you will see the 
default configuration. Click on the selected ships pane on the right and notice 
how each ship is configured.<BR><BR>OK - now it's time to create our own 
mission.<BR><BR>Click on each ship in the "selected ships" menu and hit delete 
each time until no ships appear there.<BR>
<BR>fig 4:<BR><IMG height=450 alt="" 
src="QBR Manual_files/4.jpg" width=600 border=0> <IMG height=450 alt="" 
src="QBR Manual_files/4A.jpg" width=600 border=0> <BR>Then, select the yellow 
"Systems" button at the top of the menu. on the left are the systems you have 
installed, on the right are there selected systems to be in the game. Click each 
of the three systems on the right to remove them from the list.<BR><BR>Select 
two systems from the left hand menu. We'll use Beol 1 and Biranu 1. Click on 
them and add them to the selected regions list.Now go back to the ships screen 
by clicking the yellow Ships button at the top bar. Notice that now in the 
center box, Beol 1 and Biranu 1 are listed as the only two systems.<BR><BR><IMG 
height=450 alt="" src="QBR Manual_files/5.jpg" width=600 border=0><BR>Now it's time 
to select some ships to be in the game. On the left hand ships pane, select an 
Akira, a Galaxy, and a Vorcha. Notice how they appear in the right hand pane 
with a yellow button. Now we must set each ship up with a 
configuration.<BR>
<BR><IMG height=450 alt="" src="QBR Manual_files/6.jpg" 
width=600 border=0><BR><P>Select the Akira 1 button on the right hand pane.</P>
<LI>click 
in the text box at the top to change the name of the ship - let's use the "USS 
Buttkicker"</LI><BR>
<LI>below that are the x, y, &amp; z coordinates. You can enter 
these or leave them blank for random placement</LI><BR>
<LI>below that is the custom AI text box. You can enter the filename for a custom AI script here (for advanced users)</LI><BR>
<LI>the next two buttons are "Starbase" &amp; "Warp". If you configuring 
a starbase, enable the Starbase button, but since we are doing the Akira, leave 
this blank. We do want to enable the Warp button. This will allow the ship to 
move between systems. If you do not enable this button, the ship will be 
contained in the system it starts in</LI><BR>
<LI>next down on the list is the Systems 
Box. This is very important. You must have each ship assigned to a starting 
system or the game will not load. For the Akira, we'll use Beol 1.</LI><BR>
<LI>next 
down is the AI &amp; Group boxes. Choose the AI level of the USS Buttkicker, and 
designate it "friendly"</LI><BR>
<LI>PRESS THE UPDATE BUTTON AT THE BOTTOM</LI><BR>
<P>The yellow 
"akira 1" button will now change to a blue button with the "USS Buttkicker" name 
on it. This ship is now configured for the game.You must hit the update button 
each time you change anything on this screen to save it to the 
configuration.</P>
<P>Select the Galaxy 1 button on the right hand pane.</P>
<LI>Click in the text box and change the name. I'll use "USS Enterprise"</LI><BR>
<LI>enter the x,y,z coordinates or leave them blank to have the ship start at 0,0,0</LI><BR>
<LI>Enable the Warp button</LI><BR>
<LI>Designate this ship to also start in the Beol 1 
system in the system box</LI><BR>
<LI>In the Group menu, select "PLAYER"</LI><BR>
<LI>PRESS THE UPDATE BUTTON</LI><BR>
<P>The yellow "galaxy 1" button will now turn grey and display 
"Player". This will be the ship you will control.</P><P>Select the Vorcha 1 
button on the right hand pane.</P>
<LI>Click in the text box and change the name. 
I'll use "IKV Bloody Mary"</LI><BR>
<LI>enter x,y,z, coordiantes or leave them blank for 
random placement</LI><BR>
<LI>make sure the warp button is off, so he'll stay put where 
he is</LI><BR>
<LI>have this ship start in the Biranu 1 system</LI><BR>
<LI>In the Group Menu, select "enemy"</LI><BR>
<LI>PRESS THE UPDATE BUTTON</LI><BR>
<P>The yellow "vorcha 1" button on 
the right will turn red and display "IKV Bloody Mary"</P><P>Since we are flying 
a Galaxy class ship, select the Galaxy bridge from the bridge menu at the bottom 
left. All bridges installed to the game will available here.</P>
<BR><IMG 
height=450 alt="" src="QBR Manual_files/7.jpg" width=600 border=0><P>Now it is 
time for the moment of truth - Press the red "Start" button at the top. If you 
entered everything correctly the game will start. If not, the game will freeze 
and leave you with the starfleet cursor. If this happens, don't panic. Press the 
ESC key to return to the QBR editing screen an recheck your parameters. Play the 
configuration to see how the information you entered will work in the 
game.</P><P>Now lets say for the sake of argument, that this is the coolest 
configuration you ever have or will make. Go back to the QBR editing screen (1st 
officer "configure command)</P><P>You will see the current configuration 
displayed. Click on the yellow "File" buton at the top of the menu.<BR>In the 
filename text box change the text to read "Kill the Vorcha". Then click the 
"save" button.<BR>Your new configuration will now be saved in the right hand 
load setup menu. Here you will find all the saved configurations.<BR>Click on 
any button in the right hand pane and click "Load". Go back to the Ships screen and you 
will see this configuration loaded.</P>
<BR><P>You can experiment with 
different setups at will and your are only limited by the number of ships, 
systems, and bridges you have installed. Remember, for the game to run, you MUST 
have at least one player ship, one enemy ship, and one system selected. Each 
ship must be asssigned to a system and a group. </P>
