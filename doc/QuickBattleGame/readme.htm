		<P>This replacement allows you to do a lot of things the original QuickBattle 
			doesn't.</P>
		<P>With QBR you can use all the ships and objects in the scripts\ship folder and 
			all star systems. You can even play as a starbase. All friendly ships take 
			orders. You can share your QuickBattle setups with your friends. This should be 
			also useful to modders. New ships can be used with QBR without modifications to 
			the script. (Try this with the original QuickBattle script.;))
		</P>
		<HR>
		<P><B>Installation</B><BR>
			Just run QuickBattle.exe. QBR will run only with the BC patch 1.1 and 
			Dasher42's Foundation installed. QuickBattle will not be replaced.<BR>
			'setup.bat' is no longer needed.
		</P>
		<HR>
		<P><B>Usage</B><BR>
			To play QBR you have to start Bridge Commander with the -TestMode parameter. 
			Press the 'Test Only' button. To start QBR press the 'QuickBattleGame' button 
			in the custom missions menu.</P>
		<P>All aspects of QBR are controlled with python script files. At least QBSetup.py 
			has to be present and will be loaded on startup.</P>
		<P>Since Version 2.0 you can configure most options from within a dialog. Look in 
			Saffi's menu and press 'Configure'. You can add ships and systems by clicking 
			on their buttons in the menus. When you add a ship, you must select it in the 
			right menu and change its properties. You must at least set a starting system 
			and a new position. Press 'Update' to make changes permanent. Press 'Close' to 
			cancel any changes. Press 'Start' to run the new setup.<BR>
			The player ship's name is always 'player'. All other ships must have unique 
			names. For friendly ships you might want to enter 'FleetAI' in the AI edit box.<BR>
			Neutrals don't have a default AI. They will just sit in space. You can create a 
			custom AI with the SDK's AI editor for more interesting missions.<BR>
			If you create a wrong setup, BC might crash. (I was too lazy to add a 
			validation routine. :); There is a simple check since version 2.13)<BR>
			Ship, Bridge and system mods will be added automaticlly to their menus, if they 
			are correctly installed as Foundation plugins.</P>
		<P>In the Hail menu is a new entry 'Fleet'. Here you can order all friendly ships 
			in the area to attack your current target.</P>
		<P>In the Chief Engineer's menu you will find another new button. If you press 
			'Transporter' you and your crew will be beamed to the nearest friendly ship. 
			The Transporter has a range of about 50 km.</P>
		<P>With the 'File' pane you can load and save your setups. To save a setup, enter 
			the filename without extension in the edit field and press 'Save'. To load a 
			setup select a file in the list box and press 'Load'. There is no warning, if 
			you overwrite a file, so be careful where you click.<BR>
			To start QBR with a saved setup, rename your file to 'QBSetup.py' and start a 
			new QuickBattle mission from the BC main menu.</P>
		<P>The systems of any ship or starbase can be pre-damaged randomly. Just enter the 
			minimum and maximum values of the desired damage in percent into the 
			editfields.</P>
		<P><B>Briefings</B><BR>
			If you enter text into the fields on the 'Briefing' page, your mission will be 
			preceded by a short cutscene. The first line will be shown as the title of the 
			mission. The following lines will be shown as subtitles. After the title is 
			visible, the briefing can be skipped by pressing the 's' key. Don't allow ships 
			to warp, if you are using a briefing.</P>
		<P><B>Neutrals</B><BR>
			I have added a second neutrals group 'Neutral2' which will appear gray on your 
			sensors. Both neutral groups have now a default AI. Neutral ships will attack 
			Neutral2 ships and after that enemy ships. Neutral2 ships attack Neutral ships 
			and after that all friendly ships. This should add some new possiblities for 
			games, because potential allies or enemies have nour their own agenda.</P>
		<P><B>ETA</B><BR>
			Defiant has added additional parameters to the 'Ships' page. 'ETA Min' and 'ETA 
			Max' set a random time in minutes a ship waits until it appears in its system. 
			If 'ETA Max' is lower than 'ETA Min' the ship will appear exactly at the time 
			given in 'ETA Min'. Does nothing for the Player ship.
		</P>
		<B>Critical</B><br>
		A ship marked 'Critical' influences the ending of a mission when destroyed. If 
		all ships belonging to the Enemy and Neutral2 groups are destroyed the mission is considered as 
		won. Otherwise if all critical ships of the other groups are destroyed the mission is lost. Any number of ships can set to 'Critical'. The Player 
		ship is of course always critical for the success of a mission.
		The critical ships are listed in the 'Objectives' menu of the First Officer.
		<p>
		</p>
		<HR>
		<P><B>Plugin Development</B></P>
		<P>Plugins can be used to add new features to QBR. Plugins can have their own GUI, 
			change event handlers or modify the QuickBattle setup. Plugin settings can be 
			saved within the setup script.</P>
		<P>QBR will look for three functions in a plugin:</P>
		<dir>
			<LI>
				Initialize(pMission)</LI></dir>
		This function will be called once when QBR is started.<BR>
		<dir>
			<LI>
				Restart()</LI></dir>
		This function will be called when the 'Start' button is pressed. This is for 
		any code that should be executed each time a new mission is started.<BR>
		<dir>
			<LI>
				Terminate()</LI></dir>
		This function will be called once when QBR is shut down.<BR>
		<P>The plugin module offers some convenience functions for communicating with QBR. 
			With these you can save and retrieve settings from a setup file and manipulate 
			the GUI of QBR.</P>
		<P>I have provided a template in the samples folder (plugin.py.template) for a 
			quick start. Just copy the file and rename it (eg. 'MyPlugin.py'). Then add 
			code to the functions. The next time you start up QBR your plugin will be 
			loaded and the code executed.</P>
		<P>Please have a look at the 'Briefing' plugin for an example, on how to implement 
			a plugin. It shows the usage of 'plugin.py' and how to create a simple GUI.</P>
		<P>If there is enough interest by third party developers (this means you :)) in 
			writing plugins, I will create a better tutorial.</P>
		<P><B>Docking with Starbases</B><BR>
			Despite hours of experimenting I couldn't get the 'Dock' button to work outside 
			of the 'Starbase 12' system. Therefore I abused the 'Hail' button for this 
			purpose. If you hail a Federation starbase or one of your allies the docking 
			procedure will begin. Right now only the Federation Starbase has docking 
			points.</P>
