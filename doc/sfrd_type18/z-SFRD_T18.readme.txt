CHRISTMAS Release

Type 18 Shuttle Pod
 
The Type 18 Shuttle pod was designed to supplement the new Defiant Class ship sent to DS9 during the beginning of the hostilities with the Dominion.
 
The Uss Defiant was home to 4 such craft and each was outfitted with phaser weapons but could be upgraded with other weaponry should the need arise.
 

 The Type 18 could be launched at warp and maintain a warp velocity for a short time though at least one shuttle pod was fitted with a warp drive system probably designed as an upgrade by Chief Miles O’Brien of DS9 during his refitting of the Uss Defiant once it arrived at his station dock.
