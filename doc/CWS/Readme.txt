MOD DESCRIPTION
_______________

This mod requires NanoFX 2.0 Beta to be installed in order to work. What it does is allow you to 
choose warp speeds up to 9.99 via sliderbar. 

Via plugins it allows people to define Cruising Speeds and Max Warp Speeds of ships. 

Max Warp speeds have the effect on the sliderbar allowing you only to slide up to the max designated 
speed. 

Cruise Speeds represent 'safety' speeds, beyond those speeds Warp Engines start to degrade
based on a mathematical formula. The effect in BC is done by damaging warp engines depending on several
factors. Time spent in warp and the factor how far above the 'safety' speed you've actually went. 

You don't have to set Cruise Speeds and Max Warp Speeds in order to use this mod. These are optional 
features to make BC Warping more cannon. By default Change Warp Speed (CWS) will presume that Max Warp & 
Cruise Speeds are 9.99.  

Enjoy!
