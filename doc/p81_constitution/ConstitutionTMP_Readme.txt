3. Ship info

Perhaps the most famous spacecraft in the history of Starfleet, the Enterprise is a Federation Constitution-class starship, registry number NCC-1701, launched in 2245 from the San Francisco Yards orbiting Earth. The Enterprise was originally commanded by Captain Robert April and then by Captain Christopher Pike before entering into a five year mission under Captain James Tiberius Kirk. The original Enterprise was destroyed just before its scheduled retirement in 2285, when Captain Kirk self-destructed the Enterprise so that it would not fall into the hands of the Klingon Empire. It's replacement, the NCC 1701-A was commissioned shortly thereafter by the Federation and is currently in service under the command of Captain Kirk.
