0.4.1 (alpha: looks like most is working now)

Well, just tried to give Brex some extra Power options.
Please note that the Repair Subsystems directly drains from your main Battery and
it is exponentially increasing, so carefully watch your main Battery when increasing.
Even your Impulse drive can be affected if your Repair System needs to much Power.
Saved setups can be found in scripts/Custom/QBautostart/saves/Power/.
Warning: Overloading Weapons to more then 150% can damage them!
