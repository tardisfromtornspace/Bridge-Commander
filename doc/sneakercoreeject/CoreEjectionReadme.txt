[Credits]
Sneaker98: I was alone on the scripting as always, with a few moments of using Nanobyte's NanoFx code.


[Thanks]
To Nanobyte for beta-testing and some code for using NanoFx, and to my modellers who have done awesome jobs on the cores!


[How To Use This Mod]
When you run Bridge Commander, turn on the "Sneaker98 Core Ejection" mutator button. If you have Mvam installed it will be called "Sneaker98 Core Ejection & Mvam". Then, when in QuickBattle, press the Eject Core button in Saffi's meny to dump your warp core! Blowing it up will result in a massive shockwave (provided u have NanoFX), or you can retrieve it using a tractor beam. Enjoy!


[Other Notes]
Okay guys, here's the deal: a fix to the mvam is included to this. If you have mvam installed, it'll fix it up nice. If not, dont worry its okay. If you do install the mvam overtop of the mod, reinstall this mod. I've designed this mod to function with the mvam, not the other way around. Capice? Good!
