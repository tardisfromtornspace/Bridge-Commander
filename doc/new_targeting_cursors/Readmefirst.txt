These are some new cursors for your game that I put together this afternoon, as I really didn't like the original ones and the targeting one was too big IMO.
The main cursor is the same but hollowed out and I've put together a new manual targeting cursor based on the icon from ST:Generations (the stella cartography type). I plan to release an update at some point when I've figured out where the torpedo-lock icons are. Also I have removed the orange borders from the target box.

Installation:
BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ELSE BACKUP THESE FILES FIRST IN CASE YOU DONT LIKE THESE!!!:
1.In the Data folder: 'subtarget.tga' & 'target.tga'
In Data\Icons: 'TargetCursors1.tga', 'TargetCursors2.tga' & 'TargetingCursor.tga'
2.Unzip contents into a new folder and copy the 'Data', folder into your Bridge Commander root directory. If asked to overwrite files, click yes to all.
3.Enjoy.

Bugs:
None I'm aware of
