 Zambie Zan's Borg War C-Sphere v1.0 (Jul 13, 2025) for Star Trek Bridge Commander
 
 In the year 2378, following Captain Janeway's intervention from the future — where she infected the Borg with a neurolytic pathogen and Voyager destroyed one of the Unicomplex transwarp hubs, severely crippling the Borg's ability to rapidly deploy ships across the Milky Way — the few remaining Borg were forced to adapt.

With their resources now limited, they focused on producing smaller, more heavily armored and heavily armed vessels.

The first of these new designs was the C-Sphere: a hybrid of a cube and a sphere, approximately 900 meters in diameter. Unlike traditional Borg ships, the C-Sphere was not built to assimilate, but to annihilate any threat it encountered.

I don't use BC Remastered or Kobayashi Maru or Orion or any other compilation of scripts/mods.

My version of the game is basically BC 1.1 with the mods I listed below in REQUIREMENTS.

The ship should work perfectly with any version of BC even without the mods altough it would take out all the fun.

I don't know what technologies are included in these other versions of BC. Maybe you don't need to install any mod at all.

My recomendation is that you install the ship and test it. If the shields, torpedoes, MVAM or shuttles don't work properly then it's time to consider installing the mods you're missing. BE CAREFUL! Make a backup of your files.

Have fun!
