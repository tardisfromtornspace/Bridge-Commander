Overwrite when asked
Then install FoundationTech by copying the "scripts" folder(from foundationtech20051126.zip) to your Bridge Commander installation and Overwrite when asked


Note that the torpedoes were modified(damage reduced) and they have been renamed because I did not want to distrupt the ballance of other people's BC intallations so your originals will not be overwritten ;)

Bridge Commander with 1.1 patch
NanoFxv2 (blinking lights)
Mleo's SubMenu mod (http://bridgecommander.filefront.com/file/SubMenu_Mod;27960)
