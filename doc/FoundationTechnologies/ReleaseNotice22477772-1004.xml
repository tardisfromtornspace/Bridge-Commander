	<text>That's a bummer....
So who is going to (if any) release your FoundationTech?
It's a real step forward when it comes to special feature scripting for BC.

	<text>Uh, does that include the techs you made for the FtB?
Such as the cluster torpedoes, Breen Drainer weapon, etc, etc?
Or does that go with FtB itself?

	<text>FTB needs Foundation Tech to deliver on its features.  So yes, with FTB.
