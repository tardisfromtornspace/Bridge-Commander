  This is an update of c2x Stars'n'shields mod v1, It now includes 5 different shield types
Canon TNG Warp streaks for NanoFX v2.0 BETA (with permission), New Tractor Beam texture, canon
starfield texture (to the show) and ive scripted in all of the stock systems into NanoFX 2.0

  Canon Voyager (both version) Lite and Heavy Static Versions
  Canon Early TNG Shield Texture
  Canon'ish Generations Shield Texture
