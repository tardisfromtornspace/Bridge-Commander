<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: What is Kobayashi Maru?</b> </span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: Kobayashi Maru is the successor to the highly 
successful FBCMP. It is a new Quickbattle and Multiplayer project which features 
a diverse collection of ships, scripts, effects, systems and many other elements 
to bring you a fun and entertaining Bridge Commander experience. </span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: What does Kobayashi Maru include?</b> </span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: Details of what is included in the project can be 
found on the website here
<a href="http://www.bckobayashimaru.de/" target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
http://www.bckobayashimaru.de/</a> or within the manual provided.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: Can I become a beta tester?</b> </span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: At the moment we already have enough beta testers for 
the project. But we still welcome any plausible ideas you may have to improve 
the project in the next update.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: Can I play Kobayashi Maru online?</b> </span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: Yes, the project is intended to enhance the 
multiplayer game for BC by allowing the use of AI Ships, Advanced Scripts, New 
Vessels, Unique Systems and many other great features. It also features a 
considerably more stable multiplayer engine to deliver the best experience.
</span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: Are the ships balanced against each other? Or are 
they cannon?</b> </span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: Its sort of in-between, although mainly canon-style. 
However we have done our best to try an keep it fair. Ships will possess many 
strengths and weaknesses. Remember, its not how powerful the ship is its the 
person flying it, tactics in this can make all the difference. </span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: Is there a kind of manual?</b> </span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: Yes. In the release of Kobayashi Maru a Manual, FAQ 
and Readme is provided. </span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: How do battles in warp work?</b> </span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: Warp battles are mainly chances for a pursuing enemy 
to disable a ships warp drive to prevent them from warping again, however any 
system can be targeted. In the interest of fairness both torpedoes, phasers and 
pulse weapons can be fired in warp...even a leading ship can still deal 
considerable damage with its aft weapons.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: Can ships manoeuvre in warp?</b> </span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: Yes, however in future KM updates this may be disabled 
if our feedback suggests that it would be preferred. </span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: How much control over the warp battle does the 
player have?</b> </span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: Warp battles involve a small time period in which 
ships can fire all of their weapons providing they are in range. The main 
purpose of battles in warp is to disable a ships warp drive so that they cannot 
warp again. Destroying a ship in warp is not recommended as the dead player must 
rejoin the game. </span><br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: Will it be possible to dodge beam weapons?</b>
</span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: Currently beam weapons cannot be dodged, however 
inaccurate phasers may be added at a later date to KM if feedback suggests it is 
preferred.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: What does &quot;cloak countermeasures&quot; in the 
features-list really mean?</b> </span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: There are some technologies within KM which act as 
cloak countermeasures, for example cloaked ships are vulnerable to things such 
as blast mines (which can seriously damage a cloaked ship) and blind fire (which 
can reveal a cloaked ships location). </span><br>
<span class="postbody">
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><span style="color: blue">USING TECHNOLOGIES</span>
</span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: How can I use the advanced MP mode?</b> </span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: When hosting an MP game, you must select turkey shoot 
as the game type. This is the ONLY MP game type which uses NanoFX, addship and 
other advanced scripts. </span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: How can I launch mines?</b> </span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: Only ships which are configured to launch shuttles can 
launch mines. In the Engineering menu (F5), select Prepare Mines # and choose 
the detonation delay you wish. There is no harm in preparing 20 mines since they 
are launched separately. Now in the Science Menu (F4) click the shuttle select 
button until the word Mine appears, then press Launch to deploy the mine. It 
will then detonate in the time delay, or until it is destroyed...better keep 
your distance. </span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: How can I launch shuttles?</b> </span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: Shuttle launching uses the (F4) science menu only. 
Select the shuttle you want and click the launch button. The shuttle will then 
launch from the bay of the ship. In order to board a shuttle during launch, 
click the button above the launch button, (called Player/Get on Board, Get 
Target) Then choose Get on Board. Now press the launch button and you will 
launch inside the shuttle. OR you can use the transport button providing the 
ship is within 50Km. </span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: How can I transport to another ship?</b> </span>
<br>
<span class="postbody">A: Being able to transport to an allied ship can be a 
valuable asset in a critical situation. In order to do so, you must target a 
ship within 50km range and then press the Transport Button located in the F5 
Menu. A short cut scene will play and your then transported to the new allied 
ship. </span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: What is Tractor Inversion? / How do I use it?</b>
</span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: The tractor inversion feature can be found under the 
Tactical menu within the technologies tab. Use it whenever your ship is locked 
inside an enemy tractor beam, it will send a feedback pulse along the enemy 
tractor beam and can disable the enemy tractor IF it is successful. The Tractor 
Inversion takes time to charge so you may need to wait before trying it again.
</span><br>
&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="postbody"><b><span lang="EN-GB">Q: What is 
Blind Fire? / How do I use it?</span></b><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></span>
<span lang="EN-GB"><br>
<span class="postbody">A: Blind fire is an advanced technology which allows you 
to direct phaser fire into a desired location. This is useful for detecting 
cloaked vessels as it reveals the ships location for a short time. Blind Fire 
can be found under the Tactical Menu within the Technologies tab. You must 
select a phaser direction or choose Pick Mouse in order to manually fire at a 
specific location. </span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: What is the Pick mouse Blind fire option? / How do 
I use it?</b> </span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: Pick Mouse allows you to chose where you want to 
shoot. Select it from the Blind Firing menu, and move the mouse away from the 
centre to rotate. Fire as usual. This also works for torpedoes. </span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: How can I scan for warp signatures?</b> </span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: In the science menu you must scan the area with the 
Scan Window open. Recent warp signatures will be shown which allow you to follow 
them. </span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: What is Point Defence? / How do I use it?</b>
</span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: Point defence allows you to destroy enemy torpedoes. 
This only works inside the Nebula class or Sovereign, just click the <i>Point 
Defence</i> button on the tactical menu and the Nebula will shoot the torpedoes 
for you. </span><br>

<span class="postbody"><span style="color: blue">TECHNICAL QUESTIONS</span>
</span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: I get this message when I want to play MP:</b>
</span><br>
<span class="postbody"><b><i>&quot;Your Multiplayer folder is dirty! </i></b></span>
<b><i><br>
<span class="postbody">I can't let you play with this one. </span><br>
<span class="postbody">Please clean it up. </span><br>
<span class="postbody">Game shutdown!&quot;</span></i></b><span class="postbody">
</span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: Please delete the entire scripts/Multiplayer/ folder 
in your BC installation and run the update program. OR reinstall the latest 
version of Kobayashi Maru. </span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: I get a file mismatch when trying to join an MP 
game.</b> </span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: The host/server of the game must have the same script 
files as you, you might need to download the latest Kobayashi Maru version. Or 
the host may require to do so themselves. </span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: I have found a bug in Kobayashi Maru OR I have a 
request.</b> </span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: Visit
<a href="http://bckobayashimaru.de/BugTracker/view_all_bug_page.php" target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
http://bckobayashimaru.de/BugTracker/view_all_bug_page.php</a> and report the 
bug to the online reporter. (Log in as anonymous or register to report) or 
report the bug in our Feedback section of our forums.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: I get a &quot;runtime error&quot; when I'm trying to start 
BC.</b> </span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: Delete options.cfg in your BC folder and reboot your 
machine. Or visit the Activision support website for further support. </span>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: I can not save or load my Save games or I can not 
play Single Player at all.</b> </span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: deactivate all Mutators. </span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: I get a black screen when trying to load BC.</b>
</span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: Make sure you have installed the 1.1 patch before 
Kobayashi Maru </span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: When I transport to another ship, the Phaser 
Intensity slider has reverted back to the old style.</b> </span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: This is a known issue and cannot be corrected, however 
you can still choose the phaser intensity from 3 pre-set configurations. When 
you select a new ship the slider is restored. </span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: Can I assign keys to the new features?</b> </span>
<br>
<span class="postbody">A: Yes, many of the new techs do have key support. You 
may find that in order to access the keys you will need to load a QB or MP game 
in advance, then alter them afterwards from the configure menu by pressing ESC 
during a game.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: Why don't all mods work in MP?</b> </span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: Some mods cause problems in multiplayer, and some mods 
make the game think people are cheating, therefore it was better to remove them 
from MP. However they still work fine in QB. Future KM updates may allow more 
mods to work in MP.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: The game hangs or freezes in multiplayer.</b>
</span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: There are many causes which can explain the game 
freezing. But it is most common when people are launching mines or shuttles. Try 
to reduce the amount which you launch and it should reduce the freezing. 
Otherwise freezing could be due to problems with the server. </span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: When I am killed during warp I am unable to do 
anything. My screen simply stares at the stars...</b> </span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: Being killed in warp is a problem, you will most 
likely have to rejoin the game again. </span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: I accidentally pressed Alt-Tab and now the game has 
problems</b> </span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: It is not recommended to Alt-Tab during a game. It can 
cause graphical errors or cause keys not to respond. You may have to restart BC 
to correct this issue. However altering your screen resolution can solve the 
graphical problems. </span></span></p>

<span class="postbody"><span style="color: blue">OTHER</span> </span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: How can I improve MP games for myself and others?</b>
</span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: The Bridge Commander engine is far from perfect, MP 
especially will always have its share of bugs/crashes, but there are ways to 
decrease the chances of this occurring: </span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody">-In Kobayashi Maru, you can load multiple systems in an 
MP game to allow warping. But the more systems you load, the more CPU usage 
there is on low end computers, especially if the systems have ships/bases 
included. </span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody">-Having the ability to add AI ships in MP is an amazing 
part of this project. For the first time you and your friends can literally wage 
war...BUT, don’t go loading 30 ships at a time in game, to be a good host, you 
should continue to regulate a battle by adding equal ships to team 1 or 2 
instead of having a massive amount from the beginning. While this might seem 
less fun, just think of the average computer user, who wants to enjoy your game, 
but instead suffers from frame rate issues. </span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody">-Mines and Shuttle launching can cause some degree of 
slowdown due to the time it takes BC to load the new models into the game. Try 
not to launch shuttle after shuttle, this might work fine for you, but others 
will have problems. The same may apply to mines, its not that you can’t launch 
them, but being more considerate will improve the game for others.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody">-Some ships are very demanding on graphics cards, for 
example the Excalibur. While this ship might seem like a beauty, try to remember 
that 1 of these ships is most likely enough for some computers. You don’t want 5 
Excalibur’s in game unless you have extremely good computers...try to remember 
this when choosing your ship. </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">
<br>
<span class="postbody">-Adding too many pulse capable ships can be a big source 
of lag. Specifically the Defiant class, its best if only a limited number of 
these exist at the same time, along with other ships which fire pulse weapons.
</span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody">-Abandoning ship can also cause game play issues during 
large battles due to the amount of escape pods which are launched. It’s better 
to avoid doing this when there is a large battle in progress to improve game 
play. </span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: Why are some ships no longer included like they 
were in FBCMP?</b> </span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: Upon our beta testing of Kobayashi Maru, we discovered 
that there were many ships which were simply not required or not used at all. 
Therefore we decided to remove them in order to clear unnecessary file space 
which made room for other ships instead. </span><br>
<span class="postbody">&nbsp;</span><br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: Are there any other ways to repair my ship?</b>
</span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: There several ways for your ship to get repaired in 
Kobayashi Maru. </span><br>
<span class="postbody">1) You can dock at a Starbase, this also works in MP 
battles providing the base is an ally. </span><br>
<span class="postbody">2) You can also add worker bees to the game, these are 
armed with repair beams that can repair shields, hull and systems, worker bees 
which are allies will automatically repair friendly ships. </span><br>
<span class="postbody">3) Additionally you can board an Aegian class vessel, 
which is also armed with repair beams; however it will not repair friendly ships 
automatically. </span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: Why can’t I become a Borg Cube in multiplayer?</b>
</span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: We believe that allowing people to become a Borg cube 
increases the chances of ruining the game for others. Borg Cubes are often 
considered god ships and therefore have the potential to ruin peoples games, 
both game play and performance wise. However you can add the Borg Cube as an Ai 
vessel. </span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: Do the Breen possess the drainer weapons like in 
Ds9?</b> </span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: Yes, the Breen do fire the drainer weapon which will 
drain power from the ship. Only the Klingons are immune from this weapon. </span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: Can I add my own ships/mods?</b> </span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: Only if you don’t want to play multiplayer. However 
aspects of the upcoming CA Enhancement mod and some QBautostart mods will have 
no effect on multiplayer compatibility. But remember if you want to play MP, you 
need 100% the same scripts. </span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: Why don’t ships stop when the Impulse engines are 
destroyed?</b> </span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: Because the ship is in space and there is no force to 
stop them, therefore we included a drifting mod to make the game more realistic. 
Better make sure you aren’t drifting into a planet or asteroid! </span><br>
<br>
<span class="postbody"><b>Q: There seem to be massive explosions occurring at a 
Starbase when an ally is docking in Multiplayer or when a shuttle is launched 
from a ship.</b></span><br>
<span class="postbody">A: BC does not handle collisions very well, you may 
witness large explosions even though the player responsible does not see them 
himself. This can only be solved if collisions are turned off, however the 
explosions should stop once the ship is no longer in range of the station.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="postbody"><b><span lang="EN-GB">Q: Can 
collisions be turned off during a MP game without having to restart?</span></b></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="postbody"><span lang="EN-GB">A: Yes, the host 
always controls the collision parameters.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="postbody"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="postbody"><b><span lang="EN-GB">Q: Do fleet 
orders work in MP?</span></b></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="postbody"><span lang="EN-GB">A: Yes, but only 
the host has full access to fleet orders to reduce cheating.</span></span></p>
