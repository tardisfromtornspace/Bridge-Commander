General Info
-------------------------------------
First appearing shortly after the Defiant was fitted with a 
cloaking device by the Romulans it is obvious from its
appearance that they were doing more then just fitting
the device into the ship.  The Shrike comes with a new
line of weapons, a Phased Disruptor Pulse cannon, and
the Plasma Pulse Torpedo.  The Shrike is intended to be
a post TNG era ship, as such it packs a stronger punch
then the stock models, about 1.5 the stock Sovereign.

Installation
-------------------------------------
*remember*: you must have foundation plug-in installed. download it at http://www.bcfiles.com
and you must have the BCMP to make use of the TGL included.  It must be moved to the BCMP ShipTGLs folder,
If you went with the default install that would be C:\Program Files\BC-Mod Packager\ShipTGLs

you can unzip this zip in a temporary folder and then copy data and scripts directories in you activision/bridge commander folder,
or unzip this zip directly into the bridge commander folder. Be sure you have it set to use paths, there are a few scripts all with
the same name but very different. Once all the files are in place fire up BCMP and add the ship, then use the TGL tools to install 
the description included in the TGL file.

If you don't have it download the bc mod packager at bcfiles.com

The ship comes with custom weapons and sounds for them, if you already have my "Romulan Weapons Pack" you need not 
reinstall the weapons for this ship they were included in the latest release of that mod.
