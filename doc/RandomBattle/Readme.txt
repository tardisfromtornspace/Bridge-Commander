RANDOM BATTLE V0.2

Description:
If enabled randomly selected ships will warp in and join the battle.
You can choose the difficulty and enable/disable from a predefined ship group called 'god ships'.
Depending on your PC you can switch the max ships on map limit up to 28 ships.
Once the limit is reached no ships will warp in anymore, but if you destroy some ships new reinforcements will arrive.
This limit does NOT affect shuttle launching!
This mod auto-detects every installed ship with the help of the foundation.
You'll need to create a new script for every custom installed race.
I'll write a tutorial how to do this soon.

Changes in v0.2:
Removed some console reports
Now works without KM1.0.

Installation:
1.Unrar
2.Place the scripts folder into your BC directory.

Requirements:
1. Foundation:
	It comes with the BCMP:
		http://bridgecommander.filefront.com/file/BCMP_full_version;4171
	Yust install it and select your BC-Root Directory (Default : "C:\Program Files\Activision\Bridge Commander")
	and it will notify if you haven't installed it yet
1. QB Autostart:
	http://bridgecommander.filefront.com/file/QB_Autostart;39736
2. Distress Signal(recommended, but importand files are included in this package (seperate folder)):
	http://bridgecommander.filefront.com/file/Distress_Signal;38125


If you use KM 1.0 you won't need anything!

Bugs:
No known bugs;

If you aren't using Kobayashi Maru there might be some Warnings in the console notifying of missing ships
for a specified race, just ignore them it should anyway.
