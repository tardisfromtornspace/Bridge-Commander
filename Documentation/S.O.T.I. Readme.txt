== Changelog ==
0.1 - first unofficial showcase of this mod, for feedback

== What does this mod do ==
This mod includes the Ship Of The Imagination (or S.O.T.I.) from Cosmos: "A Space-Time Odyssey" and relative music that will play when the ship

Alongside the ship, a new tech by Alex SL Gato has been added, "SOTI Inexistance", which basically makes a ship untouchable as long as shields are active.

Additionally, the Milkshape 3D file for this ship model are located under a .zip in data/Models/Ships/SOTI if you want to change it yourself.

== Dependancies ==
All of these must be installed before installing this mod, in this order:
* Foundation + Kobayashi Maru (KM has Foundation already installed - the most recent version of KM, the better).

== Credits ==
* Everyone involved in Foundation - without you this would have been a real pain to do (please read the separate Foundation.txt license) - Banbury, Dasher42, DigitalFriend, MLeo, Nanobyte and Sleight42, among others.
* Everyone involved in KM - specifically those involved in the creation of armour and Shields.py (FoundationTechnologies) the AdvArmorTech.py, FiveSecsGodPhaser.py, TractorBeams.py - Apollo from ATP Technologies as well.
* Dasher42 for reminding me of licensing.
* USS Sovereign and Elijah both for teaching me and helping me with the use of the tools.
* That Guy... Brian for telling me to install Nifskope, it has proven to be very useful to me.
* Alan Silvestri for the music.
* Tools used: Milkshape 3D and FreeCAD for modifications and adjustments so it can run on STBC, Nifskope to validate the textures.
** Original S.O.T.I model made by Thingiverse user marinosdrake  https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:362006, and is licensed under Creative Commons - Attribution - Non-Commercial (there are two extra readmes on Documentation for this one, "SOTI Model LICENSE.txt" and "SOTI Model README.txt").
* Specular texture taken from "101 005 005 v057. CDL jw2.jpg" on the VS Battles Wiki, from FOX (Disney now I guess...).
