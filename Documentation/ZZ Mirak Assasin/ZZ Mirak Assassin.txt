 Zambie Zan's Mirak Assassin , Mirak Missile and Mirak Super Weapon v1.0 (Jan 23, 2026) for Star Trek Bridge Commander
 
 
KZINTI / MIRAK WARSHIP DOSSIER

DESIGNATION: Assassin Class
HULL IDENTIFIER: IKV Killer
EMPIRE: Kzinti Patriarchy / Mirak Clans
TACTICAL TYPE: Predator Strike Cruiser

The Assassin Class exists for a single function: the sanctioned killing of enemy warships.

Kzinti naval doctrine rejects prolonged engagements, defensive maneuvering, and mercy. Victory is achieved by identifying the strongest prey, closing the distance with maximum aggression, and delivering lethal force before the enemy can adapt.

Crew survivability beyond mission completion is considered irrelevant.

The Assassin Class operates at the front of Kzinti strike formations or alone as a hunter-killer.

Standard engagement sequence:

High-velocity approach
Immediate missile saturation
Phaser fire to exploit shield failure
Super weapon deployment if prey survives
Disengage or advance to next target

Retreat is doctrinally discouraged unless it enables future kills.
