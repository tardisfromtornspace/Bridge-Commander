== Changelog ==
0.3 - Defensive Matrix 0.38 + added weapon sounds
0.2 - Adjustments to the Minotaur + Added Warp Space tech very strongly based on USS Sovereign's Slipstream
0.1 - first unofficial version of this mod, for feedback. Very W.I.P.

== What does this mod do ==
This mod adds two Starcraft Terran ships: the Terran Dominion Minotaur Battlecruiser (also known as Yamato), and the Hyperion; as well as some Starcraft Tech imitations.

For more details, read the licenses and readmes inside each file - I've done it that way so people can still use them if they separate, plus the addition is not automatic to the techs - you must include it properly.

== Dependancies ==
All of these must be installed before installing this mod, in this order:
* Foundation + Kobayashi Maru + DS9FX (KM has Foundation and DS9FX already installed - the most recent version of KM, the better).
* Turrets technology - it can be found on this Babylon 5 mod: https://www.gamefront.com/games/bridge-commander/file/stbc-babylon-5-mod

== Credits ==
* Everyone involved in Foundation - without you this would have been a real pain to do (please read the separate Foundation.txt license) - Banbury, Dasher42, DigitalFriend, MLeo, Nanobyte and Sleight42, among others
* Everyone involved in KM - specifically those involved in the creation of armour and Shields.py (FoundationTechnologies) and the AdvArmorTech.py - Apollo from ATP Technologies as well.
* USS Sovereign for the Slipstream which got modified.
* Original Minotaur (Yamato Battle Cruiser) model: 09williamsad on Thingiverse. Additionally their Creative Commons license and readme has been included on this pack, still as Creative Commons - Attribution.
* Original Hyperion model: Arawn6 on Thingiverse. Additionally their Creative Commons license and readme has been included on this pack, still as Creative Commons - Attribution.
* Alex SL Gato (aka CharaToLoki) for any new code implemented or modified - specifically the Turrets.py, the Defensive Matrix script, importing and texturing the Minotaur, some texturing of the Hyperion, and small 
tweaks to other scripts.
* Sounds:
** SCIITerranLaser, SCIIYamatoCannon, from here https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/search/space%20shooting/ combined with YT recordings of Starcraft II by Blizzard Entertainment.
** cmissle.wav - found on my isntall, probably from one of several Star Wars mods (unfortunately cannot find which one)
* For more details, read the licenses and readmes inside each file.

== Bugs ==
* The Hyperion model is prone to crashing the game if damaged in a particular way, like how it happened with the Ori Mothership from the Stargate 3.0 pack. For that reason, damage has been disabled specifically for that model.
* No other bugs noticed, but if you notice them, please feel free to share and report them
