Description:
This USS Enterprise is from the new film (ST: XI) directed by J.J. Abrahms. Coming from an alternate timeline where the Federation was threatened by a Romulan named Nero. Research was stepped up in all departments, which explains the differences between this Enterprise and the one seen in The Original Series.

Commonly nicknamed the JJPrise

This Enterprise has been hardpointed to be more powerful than the average TOS Klingon D-7. 

The only weak spots would be the aft where there are very few weapons. Just watch out for the torpedoes."
