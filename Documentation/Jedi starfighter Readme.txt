-Jedi Starfighter-

The Jedi Starfighter (or Delta-7 Aethersprite Interceptor) seen in Star Wars: Episode 2 is a small, sleek interceptor used by the Jedi Knights for reconnaissance missions. However, the starfighter was fitted with two twin-barrel laser cannons allowing the pilot to fight when necessary. As part of the Republic Judicial Department, the starfighters owned by the Jedi Order were colored in the maroon-and-white hues that represented diplomatic immunity in the Galactic Republic. It only has enough room for the 'head' of an astromech droid, and required to dock a ship or a hyperspace ring to travel faster than light.
