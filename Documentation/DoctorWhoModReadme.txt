This is a draft.

- First of all, thank you, SCI-FI KING for giving me the dalek models. I needed something compatible with my tools and you found them. Also thank them for giving me some sounds to import.
- TARDIS model modified from MadJohn's TARDIS model (basically made the model smaller).
- Dalek saucer mesh taken from an old hard drive, sorry for not finding who was the author.
- All of the meshes were imported using Milkshape and adapted to the game by Alex SL Gato.
- Importing sounds by Alex SL Gato using Audacity Portable.
- Icons done by Alex SL Gato.
- scripts: for the most part Alex SL Gato, except the Babylon 5 Jumpspace and Time Vortex technology, which was adapted from the Slipstream's creator by Alex SL Gato.
- mod/ships/hardpoint: Alex SL Gato.

==What does this mod include==
Several daleks, a Time War dalek saucer and a refurbished Doctor's type 40 TARDIS capable of entering the Time Vortex.
===Required mods===
* Kobayashi Maru (the most modern the best).
===Optional mods===
OPTIONAL (but strongly recommended for drives, while you can perfectly play without these, you lose some potential):
* Slipstream mod.
* Stargate pack 3.0 mod (specifically Hyperdrive)
* Babylon 5 super-pack mod by Alex SL Gato (jumpspace already installed with this mod as well).
