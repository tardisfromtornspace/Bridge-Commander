== Changelog ==
1.2.0 - Updates:
   * Updated AdvArmourTechThree from 1.82 to 1.83, fixed weird self-destruct bug.
   * Refurbished Time Vortex module - Now it uses GalaxyCharts and all ships can use it!
   * Updated TimeVortexTorp to 0.4 - FINALLY found a way to make it less derpy!
   * Removed unused/unrelated code.
1.1.22 - legal updates:
   * Upon noticing that the JumpspaceModule was also based on USS Soverign's script and that I had unfortuantely violated permissions, removing it from the mod.
1.1.21 - fixes:
   * Updated hull gauge fix unrelated to this mod to be more robust.
1.1.20 - fixes:
   * Updated the FIX-AblativeArmour1dot0 Autoload script to provide full starbase repair functionality and better armour inheritance.
1.1.19 - fixes:
   * Fixed unrelated health gauge bug.
1.1.18 - fixes:
   * Updated SimulatedPointDefence to prevent some MissionLib configs from preventing a proper cleanup.
1.1.17 - fixes:
   * Updated AutomaticDestroyedSystemRepairDummy to prevent some defence scripts from targeting it.
1.1.16 - bug fixes:
   * Updated AdvArmorTechThree to 1.82, which fixes a possible missing button issue.
1.1.15 - bug fixes:
   * Updated AdvArmorTechThree to 1.81, which checks things a bit better.
1.1.14 - bug fixes:
   * Updated FIX-AblativeArmour1dot0.py to correct typo in 0.2.
1.1.13 - bug fixes:
   * Updated FIX-AblativeArmour1dot0.py to 0.2 to fix a notable issue the original Ablative Armour had regarding singletons making the armour shared between the same ship type.
1.1.12 - Bug fixing:
   * Updated FIX-AblativeArmour1dot0.py to fix a small typo that currenctly did not affect any script, but could in the far future.
1.1.11 - Misc. changes:
* Updated Simulated Point Defence from 0.91 to 0.92 - this will not make the ship target projectiles that have same parent and target ID (update for compatibility with the SG Drone weaponry from CanonicalAlteranTechnologies).
1.1.10
* Potential bug fixing: Updated AdvArmourTechThree from 1.7 to 1.8, 1.8 is a tiny bit slower but it is far better for some KM installs where for some reason 1.7 might crash. If 1.7 did not crash for you, use the 1.7 script from previous versions instead.
1.1.9
* Bug fixing: updated RaceDalek and RaceTimeLord for issue that did not affect this mod, but could affect future changes to the mod.
1.1.8
* For bug fixing and fairness:
** Updated TimeVortexTorp to 0.2 (as, versioning number, the previous one was 0.1):
*** Now a ship pushed into the TimeVortex will be kinetically pushed correctly, and only when they are pushed into the TimeVortex.
*** Small tweaks for more stability during Time Vortex battles. Now if a ship dies on the time vortex, the time vortex will change colour to indicate "the time vortex is unstable due to heavy battle".
** Updated TimeVortexModule to 0.2: now we allow Helm window to be open, even if it's just to allow to do some of the things a TARDIS can do, and because it should be fair to allow the ship with the tech to have that menu, when those pushed to the TimeVortex by the torpedoes still have the Helm window.
1.1.7
* Updated AutoTargeting script to the 2009 version, no more duplicated autotargeting buttons issue.
1.1.6
* Improved AdvArmorTechThree to 1.7, fixing the dark-glow bug.
1.1.5
* Improved Simulated Point Defence to 0.92, reducing ship collision chances.
1.1.4
* Improved Simulated Point Defence to 0.91, avoiding a singleton issue.
1.1.3
* Improved Jumpspace and TimeVortex technolgoy slightly.
1.1.0 through 1.1.2
* Improved some techs.
1.0.9
* Additional additional stabilization fix to the AdvArmourThree
1.0.8
* Dalek Crucible and smaller Dalek saucers now available.
* REALITY BOMB technology polished - please remember this technology will affect a star system during an entire gaming session (like the PlanetKiller technology), so to reset a system to normal, you'll need to reload QuickBattle or close and re-open the game.
* Added secondary pulse weaponry to the other Dalek Saucers.
1.0.7
* Fix to a very outlier condition with the armour tech which could only happen if a ship dealt so much ton of millions of damage continuously so fast a possible race condition happened, thanks to Grey for detecting it!
* ??? Ehhh... it must be the alignment, I was looking at the constellation of Orion. Look! Tell me, what can you see, up there, in the sky? I can't see anything, it's just...black. But I mean, it's working, the telescope is working, there are no clouds in the sky! It was there, the entire constellat... Look, look there! They're going out! Oh my God! The Stars are going out!
1.0.6
* Small fixes to a few torpedo scripts, to prevent issues with Breen Drainer Immunity Tech breaking them.
1.0.5
* As per Dasher42's request, added the SDK License and Foundation license readme.
1.0.4
* Dalek Void Ship, Cult of Skaro and Genesis Ark added.
1.0.3
* Small fix to a script.
1.0.2
* Added one more music for Dalek Victory.
* As per Elijah's request, added the library of the Smoke trail script to reduce dependancy on Stargate Pack 3.0.
1.0.1
* Fixed two bugs, one related with losing the system you were in if you got attacked by a Time Torpedo and the other of sometimes crashing during time vortex battles. This update definetely fixes the first. While the second has been fixed as far as I'm aware as well, please tell me if it keeps happening as well as what you were doing before happening, since that bug was a bit tricky.
1.0.0 - Release of the mod.

==What does this mod include + Credits ==
Several daleks, a Time War dalek saucer, an Emperor Dalek Saucer, a Dalek Crucible, a refurbished Doctor's type 40 TARDIS, a Type 89 TARDIS, a type 560 Battle TARDIS, capable of entering the Time Vortex and more thanks to their technologies (yes, yes, that includes the Reality Bomb too). This Time Vortex Travelling Method works for all vessels and AI.

- First of all, thank you, SCI-FI KING for giving me the dalek models. I needed something compatible with my tools and you found them. Also thank them for giving me some sounds to import.
- TARDIS model modified from MadJohn's TARDIS model (basically made the model smaller).
- Dalek saucer mesh taken from an old hard drive, sorry for not finding who was the author.
- Battle TARDIS model and textures made by Alex SL Gato using Milkshape and GIMP, based on the Doctor Who Time War Comics.
- All of the meshes were imported using Milkshape and adapted to the game by Alex SL Gato.
- Some music taken from the Gwylock1 Archive.
- Some sounds from BBC, recordings on YouTube, The Tardis Databank (http://www.kasterborus.com/tardis/) and the 50th Doctor Who Anniversary.
- Importing sounds by Alex SL Gato using Audacity Portable.
- Icons done by Alex SL Gato.
- scripts: Alex SL Gato, using notepad only.
- mod/ships/hardpoint: Alex SL Gato, using notepad only.
- some parts of code and advice from USS Sovereign (Mario) and BCS:TNG. Thank you to Mario from BCCentral for aiding me with some ShipDef counseling

===Required mods===
* Foundation + FoundationTech + Kobayashi Maru (the most modern the best. Foundation and FoundationTech already come by default with KM).
* GalaxyCharts (already by default on KM, just make sure its Mutator on Options -> Customize -> Mutators is active or you will not be able to enter the Time Vortex beyond maybe being forced into it by a Battle Tardis Time Missile).
===Optional mods===
OPTIONAL (but strongly recommended for drives, while you can perfectly play without these, you lose some potential):
* Slipstream mod.
* Stargate pack 3.0 mod (specifically Hyperdrive)
* Babylon 5 super-pack mod by Alex SL Gato.

=== How to install ===
1ยบ Ok, first of all, just in case, backup your STBC. After that please verify you have the mods above installed.

2ยบ After that, just unzip the files into your STBC folder, say "yes" to overwrite all the files.

3ยบ After opening your STBC go to the options and activate all the new incorporated mutators (this mod uses foundation, all variants of Mvam, auto-targeting, and newer technologies. Ensure all of those Mutators are online when playing to get the best experience of the Doctor Who mod).

4ยบ Enjoy!
