1.0.9
* Additional additional stabilization fix to the AdvArmourThree
1.0.8
* Dalek Crucible and smaller Dalek saucers now available.
* REALITY BOMB technology polished - please remember this technology will affect a star system during an entire gaming session (like the PlanetKiller technology), so to reset a system to normal, you'll need to reload QuickBattle or close and re-open the game.
* Added secondary pulse weaponry to the other Dalek Saucers.
1.0.7
* Fix to a very outlier condition with the armour tech which could only happen if a ship dealt so much ton of millions of damage continuously so fast a possible race condition happened, thanks to Grey for detecting it!
* ??? Ehhh... it must be the alignment, I was looking at the constellation of Orion. Look! Tell me, what can you see, up there, in the sky? I can't see anything, it's just...black. But I mean, it's working, the telescope is working, there are no clouds in the sky! It was there, the entire constellat... Look, look there! They're going out! Oh my God! The Stars are going out!
1.0.6
* Small fixes to a few torpedo scripts, to prevent issues with Breen Drainer Immunity Tech breaking them.
1.0.5
* As per Dasher42's request, added the SDK License and Foundation license readme.
1.0.4
* Dalek Void Ship, Cult of Skaro and Genesis Ark added.
1.0.3

1.0.2
* Added one more music for Dalek Victory.

1.0.1
* Fixed two bugs, one related with losing the system you were in if you got attacked by a Time Torpedo and the other of sometimes crashing during time vortex battles. This update definetely fixes the first. While the second has been fixed as far as I'm aware as well, please tell me if it keeps happening as well as what you were doing before happening, since that bug was a bit tricky.

OPTIONAL (but strongly recommended for drives, while you can perfectly play without these, you lose some potential):

* Babylon 5 super-pack mod by Alex SL Gato (jumpspace already installed with this mod as well).

=== How to install ===
1ยบ Ok, first of all, just in case, backup your STBC. After that please verify you have the mods above installed.

2ยบ After that, just unzip the files into your STBC folder, say "yes" to overwrite all the files.

3ยบ After opening your STBC go to the options and activate "The Jumpspace" and "The TimeVortex" in start menu, and then activate all the new incorporated mutators (this mod uses foundation, all variants of Mvam, Jumpspace, TimeVortex, auto-targeting, redistribute shields and repair destroyed systems mod. Ensure all of those Mutators are activated when playing to get the best experience of the B5 mod).

4ยบ Enjoy!
