== Changelog ==
0.9.5 - several bugfixes - drainer weapons bugs and drone crashing the game if the ship launching the droens died are now fixed
0.9 - first unofficial release of this tweak, for feedback

== What does this mod do ==
This mod makes the Atlantis and AncientCity from the Stargate pack 3.0 far more canonical by tweaking their shields and weaponry:
* Shields now follow canon configuration (shiels cannot normally drop unless the Main Battery/ZPM has been depleted).
* Drones tweak:
** Power reduction by a third.
** Increased range and lifetime.
** Now they have the chance to come back and forth between ships, doing multiple strikes at the same ship before dying.

== Dependancies ==
All of these must be installed before installing this mod, in this order:
* Foundation + Kobayashi Maru (has Foundation already installed - the most recent, the better)
* Stargate pack 3.0 or 4.0 https://www.gamefront.com/games/bridge-commander/file/stargate-ship-pack-dave975-and-dkealt

== Credits ==
* Everyone involved in Foundation - without you this would have been a real pain to do.
* Everyone involved in KM - specifically those involved in the creation of armour and Shields.py (FoundationTechnologies) and the AdvArmorTech.py
* Dasher42, not only for the above but for some feedback.
* .truncatedcake0161 for feedback on the Discord abut power tweaks.

== Bugs ==
* As stated from the Ancient City pack, these models cannot handle damage textures so they are turned off for these models only - no performance limitations.
* Due to circumstances that are not from this mod:
** Big enough ships have strange collisions that may make drones far less effective - no game performance impact.
** On some installs firing too many drones at the same time may consume memory.
