Description:

Featured are the 15-mile wide City Destroyers and Alien Fighters from the movie Independence Day (ID4). The Alien ships have strong hulls and shields, and the primary weapon of the City Destroyers can be destroyed in one shot as they should be. The "Flight Mode" city destroyer can launch fighters if your install includes shuttle launching. The Captured Alien Attacker features repaired hull panels and a single Tactical Nuclear Warhead capable of destroying most smaller ships with a single shot. Enjoy!
