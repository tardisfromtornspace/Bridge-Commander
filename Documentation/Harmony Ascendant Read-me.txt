Description:

This is Harmony Ascendant. This is what became of Harmony's Spirit after the Void collectively cast it into the infinity cloud. When they did, they allowed it to finish its treansformation that it was heading towards. This then appeared to decimate the Void races and completed the barrier that keeps them in the Void. After that, it remained in the infinity cloud until the times it is required or when the time came that it was forced to leave the forisium to chase the Void races. The Harmony Ascendant is equipped with Infinity Resonance Beams, Prismic Pulses, Foriphasic Torpedoes, Hyperinversal Torpedoes, a powerful Hypermagiversive Cutting Beam, and the ultimate advancement in cloaking abilities and the most complex and advanced warp capabilities of the entire forisium. This ship is able to best the Exile with a fair amount of ease.
