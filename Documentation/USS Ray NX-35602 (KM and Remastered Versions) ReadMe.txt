Updated 2023-June-10 by Alex SL Gato with the following changes:
- made an example of what I suggested about having both work, attempting to try KM and if taht didn't work try Remastered. This is a half-ironed example and will probably have more optimizations later.
Updated 2023-06-01 by MSR1701 with the following changes:
- script for Torpedoes updated to use "Photon 7" and "Quantum 3" for BC RE v1.2
- Ship Plugin added to load the ship under "Federation Ships"
- sfx updated to use "Galaxy Phaser" sfx for compatibility with BC RE v1.2
No other changes were effected to the model, textures and scripts on this update.
