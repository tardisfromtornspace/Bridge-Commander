== Changelog ==
1.2.2 - Bug fixing:
   * Updated AdvArmortechThree to 1.82 fix a possible missing button issue.
1.2.1 - Bug fixing:
   * Updated AdvArmortechThree to 1.81 to make it check things a bit better.
1.2.0 - Bug fixing:
   * Updated Gravitic Lance to 1.4 to correct a small issue with a timer.
1.1.9 - Bug fixing:
   * Updated Gravitic Lance to 1.3 to correct a small issue with a sequence.
1.1.8 - Bug fixing:
   * Updated Gravitic Lance to 1.2 to correct small issue with a sequence.
1.1.7 - Bug fixing:
   * Updated FIX-AblativeArmour1dot0.py to correct typo in 0.2.
1.1.6 - Bug fixing:
   * Updated FIX-AblativeArmour1dot0.py to 0.2 to fix a notable issue the original Ablative Armour had regarding singletons making the armour shared between the same ship type.
1.1.5 - Bug fixing:
   * Updated FIX-AblativeArmour1dot0.py to fix a small typo that currenctly did not affect any script, but could in the far future.
1.1.4 - Misc. changes:
   * Updated Simulated Point Defence from 0.91 to 0.92 - this will not make the ship target projectiles that have same parent and target ID (update for compatibility with the SG Drone weaponry from CanonicalAlteranTechnologies).
1.1.3 - Potential bug fixing
 * Updated AdvArmourTechThree from 1.7 to 1.8, 1.8 is a tiny bit slower but it is far better for some KM installs where for some reason 1.7 might crash. If 1.7 did not crash for you, use the 1.7 script from previous versions instead.
1.1.2 - Bug fixing
 * Upgraded AdvArmorTechThree to 1.7, eliminating the dark-glow issue.
1.1.0 to 1.1.1 - Bug fixing
 * Upgraded Simulated Point Defence from 0.91 to 0.92, reducing ship collision issues.
1.0.6 to 1.0.9 - Bug fixing
 * Refined armour even more and fixed a same-name potential issue
 * Refined Simulated Point Defense to avoid editing a singleton.
1.0.5 - Bug Fixing
 * Energy armour had a bug in an outlier condition, now it has been tackled. Thanks Grey for noticing it out!
1.0.4 - Bug Fixing
 * Upgraded Simulated Point Defence from 0.8 to 0.9, now two possible crash causes upon heavy fire have been removed. Thank USS Sovereign for telling me how to use the debug function properly.
1.0.3 - Bug Fixing
 * Upgraded Simulated Point Defence from 0.6 to 0.8, now a lot of the weird behaviour happening before has been fixed.
1.0.2 - Bug fixing
 * Fixed Simulated Point Defence TypeError sequence issue - it didn't really cause any problems but it was flagged on the console and would have caused problems if the sequence had multiple actions.
1.0.1 - Another balance update
 * Severely nerfed the shields and armour.
1.0 - Official Mod Release
 * Fix on Gravitic Lance
0.9 - Small refinement of the Simulated Point Defence script.
0.8 - Model and script fixes and balancing:
 * Blinker effects added via diffusion, we are still investigating what makes the Animations via NifSkope crash using CGSovereign model as a base, something related with TriShape and re-ordering indexes, albeit that doesn't seem to be the cause?
 * Tweaks to bussard_glow.tga to make it redder and more glowy.
 * Tweaks to deflector_glow to make it a bit more lavender.
 * Tweaks to forehull_glow to be more regular.
 * Added fix for AblativeArmour eroding itself with time due to not repairing at all.
 * Nerfed shields even further.
 * Buffed Gravitic Lance again.
 * Adjusted Siphoon effect to properly adjust to distance.
 * Added Playerside PointDefense with the Enterprise J included, RepairSystems and Redistribute shields.
0.7 - More balancing
 * Reduced adv armour battery strength.
 * Placed shuttle 2D position on its correct place.
 * Nerfed impulse speed and rotation speed and acceleration again.
 * Nerfed a bit Multivectral and Regenerative shielding chances and regeneration once again, as well as reflux weapon defense drain.
 * Removed Quad torpedo fire from this ship.
 - Still awaiting for finding Nifskope 0.9.8 to add nif-side blinkers. Experiments with tweaking nifskope 1.0.2 manage to create a decent animation and do not crash the game directly, but would still cause the game to take forever to load.
 - Asking for feedback regarding all of the above, including if the project should have nanoFX beta blinkers again or forego any blinkers.
0.6.1 - Code cleanup and extra balancing
 * Removed the misaligned shift-space on the hardpoint, found by THE SCI-FI KING, they were not causing any problems but they may make an interpreter mad.
 * Reduced max angular acceleration and speed once more 
0.6 - Balancing:
 * Nerfed shield strength
 * Nerfed Adv Energy Armour strength
 * Buffed Gravitic Lance hardpoint damaging power.
 * Removed Fed Ablative Armour due to creating a synergy with the other armours that made the ship invincible to everything except a ship colliding with it
 * Reduced max angular acceleration to avoid Breakdancing AI capable of doing the most crazy maneuvers
 * Buffed AOE Draining range for the Enterprise J and made it negative (now it powers up allies and herself, instead of draining enemy power in the area)
    - Awaiting for finding Nifskope 0.9.8 to add nif-side blinkers.
    - first unofficial release of the whole mod.
0.5 - Added Gravitic Lance to the Enterprise J - sounds thanks to Grey da Derg#2305
0.4 - Included Gravitic Lance and Tachyon Beam techs
0.3 - Added monkey patch for TractorBeams.py small error
0.2 - Added feedback - removed nanofx blinkers and glows
0.1 - first unofficial showcase of this mod, for feedback

== What does this mod do ==
This mod includes an improved Enterprise J model and icon, closer to the canon deal, plus a reinforced Hardpoint and its additional technologies, including a gravitic lance - with the exception of Slipstream.
It also includes some technology fixes to Power Drain Beam and Tractor Inversion so they can actually draw power, and a fix to AblativeArmour.py by the Foundation Technologies Team so the armour can repair like a normal subsystem; by Alex SL Gato.
If you want to fuse those monkey patches with the original file, feel free to do so, I only do the monkey patch to avoid versioning problems.

Additionally, the Milkshape 3D file for this model, as well as a diffused version with duller blinkers are located under two .zip in data/Models/Ships/EnterpriseJ/ if you want to change it yourself.

== Dependancies ==
All of these must be installed before installing this mod, in this order:
* Foundation + Kobayashi Maru (KM has Foundation already installed - the most recent version of KM, the better).
* Slipstream mod (not wholly necessary but the Enterprise J hardpoint supports slipstream).
* UNLIKE THE ORIGINAL, NanoFX is not immediately required, as I removed the blinkers.
* Tachyon Beam Technology >=1.1.5 https://www.gamefront.com/games/bridge-commander/file/tachyon-beam-customizable-tech
** 1.1.5 is already installed with this pack
** DO NOT USE LESSER VERSIONS UNLESS YOU WANT THE SHIP TO AUTOMATICALLY HAVE ALL PHASERS AS TACHYON BEAMS

* Dasher42 for reminding me of licensing.
* USS Sovereign for some DS9FX advice regarding timers - a LOT of tips for Alex SL Gato's DampeningAOEDefensiveField.py
* USS Sovereign and Elijah both for teaching me and helping me with the use of the tools.
* Defiant for the original PointDefence.py, which got altered later somewhere.
* LJ for inspiration to see friendly, enemy and neutral ships
* fekleyrtarg for telling me that decimation exists in Blender... albeit I ended up using FreeCad decimation instead lol.
* That Guy... Brian for telling me to install Nifskope, it has proven to be very useful to me.
* Tools used: Blender for importing the original model to Milkshape, Milkshape 3D and FreeCAD for extensive modifications and adjustments so it can run on STBC and it's the real Enterprise J and not some hybrid, Nifskope to validate the textures.

== Bugs ==
* Enterprise J damage is a bit wonky, nothing that causes the model to crash or performance issues or anything but aesthethically the model itself may look like it was peeled off if it takes too much damage.
* No other bugs noticed, but if you notice them, please feel free to share and report them.
