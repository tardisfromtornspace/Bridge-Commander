About--------------------

Enterprise is a prototype vessel of Earth Starfleet equipped with the first human-built propulsion system to achieve Warp 5. The starship was conceived by Henry Archer, with the support of Zefram Cochrane, and it took more than 30 years until it could finally be commissioned. Its hull is made of duranium. Enterprise sports phase cannons and torpedoes, protection is achieved through polarized hull plating. A transporting device is available, but transport of personnel is restricted to states of emergency. Enterprise has a shuttle drop bay and a grappler, a mechanical device to tow smaller vessels.

The NX-Refit-----

Official Description from Ships of the Line Calendar 2011:
The original NX-class Enterprise design was a spectacular success by most measures. Henry Archer's revolutionary warp 5 engine proved its value as an enabler for deep space operations across a multisector range. Still, postmission analysis after the costly Xindi conflict of 2153 revealed the engine's original matter/antimatter reactor core to be underpowered in combat situations. Starfleet quickly determined that retrofitting the core would be necessary, given the ship's ongoing role in Earth's exploration of deep space and its value in planetary defense. This proved problematic in that installing a larger core in the ship's primary hull would have entailed rebuilding most of the saucer section. Fortunately, Starfleet engineers devised a radical solution: Adding an outboard module specifically designed to house an uprated reactor core and related engineering systems. This engineering module would be designed to occupy the secondary lobe of the ship's subspace field during warp flight. In this way, the existing warp nacelles could be fed by a greatly uprated reactor, while avoiding a time-consuming reconstruction of the primary hull. Additionally, the ship's original main deflector had been found to be inadequate during warp travel through regions of dense interstellar particulates, so a second, larger dish was incorporated into the design. Installation of the new engineering hull was surprisingly straightforward, and the NX-class Enterprise was returned to service after only 180 days in spacedock, resuming its historic mission to boldly go where no man had gone before.
