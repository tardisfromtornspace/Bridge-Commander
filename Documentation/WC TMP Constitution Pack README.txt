About--------------------

The USS Enterprise as seen in Star Trek 1-6 is possibly the most iconic spaceship (other than the TOS Enterprise) and favorite starship among fans. This version is based from Tobias Righter's renders and features intricate detailing/pearescent aztec paneling as seen in Star Trek 1. Two versions of textures are featured in this pack- Star Trek 1 (with the spotlights and green details), and Star Trek IV-VI (with the lack of spotlights, and blue details).

This pack uses ID map swapping to take advantage of the numerous registries. All of the Constitution Class ships featured in TOS and TMP are included. Some ships that have been destroyed or missing in the TOS-era have their approprate "-A" refit registry.

Constitution NCC-1700
