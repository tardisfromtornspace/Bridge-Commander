==== Slipstream Plugin v0.9 for Galaxy Charts =========
==== by BCXtreme ======================================
=======================================================

Description:  This is an addon script for USS Frontier's Galaxy Charts v2.0 that adds rudimentary Slipstream functionality.

Note:  I abandoned this project some time ago, and therefore it is being released unsupported.  Several things are not working, including the entry and exit Slipstream effects.  The tunnel however is working.  This does not replace or modify Slipsteam or Galaxy Charts in any way.

=== REQUIREMENTS ===
Slipstream Framework v1.0
Galaxy Charts v2.0
and all of their requirements

=== INSTALLATION ===
Drop the scripts folder in your Bridge Commander directory.

=== CREDIT ===
USS Sovereign, for creating the Slipstream Framework and allowing me to do this plugin.
USS Frontier, for creating Galaxy Charts and helping me get off the ground with this.

=== PERMISSIONS ===
I am releasing this unfinished.  As far as I am concerned, anyone can take this and finish it if they want to.  You may want to check with BCS-TNG before releasing any modification of this work, and be sure they still approve of the usage of the Slipstream Framework.
