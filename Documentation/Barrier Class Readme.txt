Barrier Class Federation Battle cruiser - 527m

Barrier class ships are pure battle cruisers based upon the primary hull characteristics of the Sovereign class but in a more compact design, thus resulting in a stronger hull and higher impulse speeds and maneuverability than the larger Sovereign.  Most of the interior space is devoted to shuttle bays, propulsion systems, and weapons with little in the way of scientific capability or modularity.  The Barrier's armament is potent for a vessel its size and is arranged to deliver devastating alpha strikes and full 360 degree phaser coverage.  Regenerative shielding and several centimeters of Ablative Armor serve as defense, along with the vessel's surprising agility.

This ship has one unique feature: a detachable weapons pod that operates as an independent sub light Attack Wing providing the Barrier with Multivectoral Attack Mode capabilities.  It is a formidable craft for its size, equipped with advanced targeting sensors, weapons systems, and defenses, its sleek design gives it good handling characteristics in an atmosphere and provides fleet and base defense as well as support for ground troops, and securing planetary and small space targets.

22 Advanced Burst Phaser Arrays (18 main hull, 4 attack wing)
