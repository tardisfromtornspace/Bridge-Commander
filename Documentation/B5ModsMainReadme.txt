***Basically every other Babylon 5 ship mod has been overhauled by Alex SL Gato to include Jumpspace Drive, usually additional weapons and techs, and to balance each other - for example we had a Minbari cruiser to the level of a Sovereign and then we had a regular Omega which crushed easily several Minbari Sharlins, that won't do.***

===Mods required===
You'll of course need Foundation, Nanofx2, Submenu v 3.0, QBAutostart and Kobayashi Maru mod, the latest version the better. 

===Installation Guide===
1ยบ Ok, first of all, just in case, backup your STBC.

2ยบ After that, just unzip the files into your STBC folder, say "yes" to overwrite all the files.

3ยบ After opening your STBC go to the options and activate "The Jumpspace" in start menu, and then activate all the new incorporated mutators (this mod uses foundation, all variants of Mvam, B5 uniforms, and Jumpspace, plus point defence, redistribute shields and repair destroyed systems mod. Ensure all of those Mutators are activated when playing to get the best experience of the B5 mod).

4ยบ It's strongly recommended to activate DS9FX so No Damage through Shields is active, but it's not necessary.

--- Why those mutators/configurations are important ---

1st: Without the jumpspace mod active, none of the Younger Races ships can leave the system (to make it more canon to the series). Oh, and don't worry, I made it so the jumpspace engines can actually be engines so you can actually use emergency repair and repair destroyed systems properly on them... unlike the Hyperdrive or Slipstream mods.

2nd Foundation is vital because for most of the Babylon 5 races, there's at least one Foundation function working to make it more canonical, with No Damage Through Shields helping considerably on overriding normal shield behaviour. Without those functions the ship defences for most babylon 5 ships are pretty weak since they'll have no defence grids, point defence, gravitational defences, polycristalline armour... just the unmodded shield which was only used as a token to make the modded defences work.
* That token shield is meant to be extremely weak and have little regeneration because:
** Canonically, most Babylon 5 races don't have a bubble energy shield like Star Trek.
** A strong bubble shield on Star Trek Bridge Commander is capable of preventing beam weapons from actually hitting the hull even with the "no damage through shields" DS9FX option active, unless you make them ridiculously powerful, to the point in order to make an Earth Alliance ship be capable of firing beams which can hit the hull of another Omega like in the real show, you cannot have an omega or hyperion-class level of laser power to hit through, they need to have a beam as powerful as the Ori blast beam or the original Shadow Battlecrab mod - for a reference, that old mod could insta-kill the Armoured Voyager and any normal Omega in half a second - and that won't do.
** The token shield combined with the modded techs ensures that Beams actually are the most powerful weapon in Babylon 5, instead of a random person firing pulses o torpedoes - a shield in unmodded STBC actually recovers strength even while being hit, so beams against a fast-regenerating shield become almost worthless, while torpedoes and pulses give their payload damage in a single instant.
