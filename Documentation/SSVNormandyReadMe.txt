1.3 MOD INFO :

Model and textures were extracted from Mass Effect and converted for Bridge Commander. Glows and specaular highlights were altered to suit BC graphic engine so the ship appears the same as it was in ME. Specular Highlights were adjusted to compensate the lack of Normal Maps. Hardpoints are as canon as can be, so expect the ship to be lightly armed and very maneuverable.
