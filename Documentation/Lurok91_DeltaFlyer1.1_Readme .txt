Filename : Delta Flyer Cockpit v.1.1.rar
Version : 1.1

Author : Lurok91


CHANGELOG SINCE V1.0
--------------------------------

This new beta release is to get feedback on new open side windows and viewscreen.  Please report any helpful feedback in the Delta Flyer WIP thread at BCC.  As textures unchanged, this beta release only includes new bridge model and viewscreen, and revised animations and scripts which should overwrite original beta install.  


V.1.1 Experimental Viewscreen:

To give the illusion of total conversion, the cockpit viewscreen was made into a globe. This in theory should give the player
the immersion of seeing visible movement on the port and starboard cockpit viewports.


v.1.0 Known Bug/Issues: 
 
There will be stretch/distortion as eyeline moves to edges of viewscreen.  Also repeat of ingame target model as eyeline moves to left edge of viewscreen. 
These seem to be endemic to model properties in BC engine and may not be resolveable but will continue to experiment.



DESCRIPTION
------------------

This is iconic Delta Flyer bridge as seen in Star Trek: Voyager.  This set comes with custom red, yellow and green alerts. To give the illusion of total conversion, the bridge cockpit viewscreen was made into a globe. This should give the player, the immersion of seeing visible action movement on the port and starboard cockpit viewports.
