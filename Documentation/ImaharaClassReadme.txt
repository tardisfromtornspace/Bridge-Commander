== Changelog ==
1.0.11
* Updated AdvArmourTechThree from 1.82 to 1.83, fixed weird self-destruct bug.
1.0.10
* Updated AdvArmourTechThree from 1.81 to 1.82, fixing certain issues where the buttons were not disappearing accordingly.
1.0.9
* Updated AdvArmourTechThree from 1.8 to 1.81, 1.81 checks things a bit better.
1.0.8
* Updated AdvArmourTechThree from 1.7 to 1.8, 1.8 is a tiny bit slower but it is far better for some KM installs where for some reason 1.7 might crash. If 1.7 did not crash for you, use the 1.7 script from previous versions instead.
1.0.7
* Bugfix to RaceMixedGalaxyQuest, for an underlying bug that did not affect this mod, but could affect future versions of the mod.
1.0.6
* Updated Autotargeting script to 2009 version, so no more replicated buttons issue.
1.0.3 to 1.0.5
* Updated some scripts, including AdvArmourTechThree to 1.7, finally fixing the tech bug that left some ships in the black.
1.0.2
* Small fix to some techs so the Breen Drainer Immunity doesn't break them.
* Removed Time Vortex torpedo - it should not be there. Thanks for THE SCCI-FI KING for pointing it out!
1.0.1
* Per Dasher42's request, added the SDKLIcense and the Foundation readme.
1.0 
* Mod release

== About this mod ==
The Imahara class mod adds an alternate-timeline Oberth class from the 31st Century. This started as a joke between our team upon seeing a Star Trek USS Ambassador with the Galaxy Quest's NSEA Protector "nacelles", and then that 31st Century ship being practically a Mass Effect ripoff, and ended up like this. Enjoy.
We've left our milkshape file at data/Models/Ships/31stOberth so you can improve upon it!

== Required mods ==
* Kobayashi Maru Mod (the newest, the better. I personally used KM 2011).
* Foundation Technologies (already installed on Kobayashi Maru).

== Installation guide ==
1ยบ Ok, first of all, just in case, backup your STBC.
2ยบ After that, just unzip the files into your STBC folder, say "yes" to overwrite all the files.

--- Known Bugs ---
* None :)

- if you find any bugs, report them, please.
