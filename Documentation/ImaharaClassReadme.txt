== Changelog ==
* 1.0 Mod release

== About this mod ==
The Imahara class mod adds an alternate-timeline Oberth class from the 31st Century. This started as a joke between our team upon seeing a Star Trek USS Ambassador with the Galaxy Quest's NSEA Protector "nacelles", and then that 31st Century ship being practically a Mass Effect ripoff, and ended up like this. Enjoy.
We've left our milkshape file at data/Models/Ships/31stOberth so you can improve upon it!

== Required mods ==
* Kobayashi Maru Mod (the newest, the better. I personally used KM 2011).
* Foundation Technologies (already installed on Kobayashi Maru).

== Installation guide ==
1ยบ Ok, first of all, just in case, backup your STBC.
2ยบ After that, just unzip the files into your STBC folder, say "yes" to overwrite all the files.

--- Known Bugs ---
* None :)

- if you find any bugs, report them, please.
