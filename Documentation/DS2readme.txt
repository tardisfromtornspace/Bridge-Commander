Hi there partener (birdie nam nam)!

I just made this model last night and thought I'd release it right away. I don't know when I'll get time to work more on it so the updates probably won't happen any time soon. The opacity map needs work. I would have fixed it but since I'm nearly all out of space Photoshop complained that scratchdisk was full hence I was limited and couldn't finish it as I would have liked. Anyway..

The model: 

As you can see the DeathStar has a blueish colour and depending on which kind of look you're going for you could make the panels grey by making the bitmap-maps a RGB map and tone the colours grey there, that should do the trick.

Should you want to make a conversion and release it please contact me at: thomas@spacecadet.dk Should you want to host the file somewhere feel free to do so but do contact me before hand. :-)

On a personal note:

I would really like to see what you make of this model if you use it in a scene so if you have the time please send me some images or animations at: thomas@spacecadet.dk :-)


Enjoy!
