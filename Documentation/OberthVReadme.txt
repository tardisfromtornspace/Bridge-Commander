== Changelog ==
* 1.0 Mod release

== About this mod ==
The Imahara class mod adds an alternate-timeline Oberth class from the 31st Century. This started as a joke between our team upon seeing a Star Trek USS Ambassador with the Galaxy Quest's NSEA Protector "nacelles", and then that 31st Century ship being practically a Mass Effect ripoff, and ended up like this. Enjoy.
We've left our milkshape file at data/Models/Ships/31stOberth so you can improve upon it!
