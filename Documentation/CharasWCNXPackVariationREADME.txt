==CHANGES DONE ON THIS MOD==
This mod aims for a more canon ship, that is, power-level-wise and tech-level wise. As such:
- Added new AblativeArmour variation, will reduce damage consideraly but some damage will bleed through.
- Reduced shield strength on most ships to a token value (equivalent to pouring more power to polarizing the hull).
- Reduced overall weaponry power.
- Increased burn and hole values for some ships. Now it'll take a bit longer to make a hole on those ships.
- Added warp speed limits.
- Added some extra "lore" to the descriptions.

== Credits ==
* Special thanks to all the people involved in Foundation and Kobayashi Maru - specially Dasher42 and MLeo.
* Alex SL Gato by doing the modifications mentioned above.
* WileyCoyote for lots of the coolest ships around.
** I've personally asked for permission from WileyCoyote via e-mail and while I didn't get a respose there, I got a response from the Discord via a trusted intermediary (THE-SCI-FI-KING) who told me "He said along you give proper credit he is fine".
* I've tried to find all the readmes about the original mods these pack modifies, specially the WC NX Pack and the Xindi Aquatic, Insectoid and 22nd Century Tholian ship. Those involved with those other mods are included there.
