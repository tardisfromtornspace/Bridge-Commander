Name: Modified armored voyager one(MVAM)

Description:
This is a modified version of Voyager 0ne.  The ship's transphasic torpedo hardpoint has been slightly changed along with the transphasic torpedo.
The Torpedo was changed to a modified 'Transphasic_Plasma' (I modified the colours and the strength to make it more canon to the Final episode of 
voyager when it was destroying cubes in 2 shots.... muahahahaha).  This torpedo is most likely the most powerful torpedo on Filefront as it can destroy a 
borgpack borg tactical cube in 2 hits.  I strongly suggest that this NOT be made a multiplayer ship/torpedo because of the radical power of the torpedo.
The ship's textures and model was not altered.  When you activate the armour (via MVAM) the torpedo 'T Plasma' is your transphasic torp.  And it is loaded
first above all other torps so all you have to do is fire.  The torpedo is not accessable without the armour.
Unfortunately MVAM is not compatable with QBR so you wont be able to MVAM in QuickBattleGame.
But standard QB is fully compatable with MVAM.

Installation:
1. copy the data, scripts, and sfx folders into your bridge commander root folder.
2. launch bridge commander.
3. give the toughest borg cube you can find the Butt-kicking of the century.

Requirements:
NanoFXV2 for blinkers and such.
Mvam Infinite
Future Technologies 2.0 plugin
Foundation
BC patch 1.1
BCMI
