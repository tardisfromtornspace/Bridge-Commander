Background:
The TARDIS[1][2] is a time machine and spacecraft in the British science fiction television programme Doctor Who. 
The name is an acronym of Time And Relative Dimension(s) In Space.[3]
A product of Time Lord technology, a properly maintained and piloted TARDIS can transport its occupants to any point in time and space.
 The interior of a TARDIS is much larger than its exterior, which can blend in with its surroundings through the ship's chameleon circuit.
 In the series, the Doctor pilots an unreliable, stolen, obsolete Type 40 TARDIS, once referred to as a TT Capsule, whose chameleon circuit is faulty, leaving it locked in the shape of a 1950s-style London police box. 
It was stolen from the shipyards of Gallifrey where it had been stripped for spare parts, and the unpredictability of the TARDIS' short range guidance — that is, relative to the size of the entire Universe —
 has often been a plot point in the Doctor's travels. -Source - Wikipedia
