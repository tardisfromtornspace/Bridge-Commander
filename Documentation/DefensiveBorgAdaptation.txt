== Changelog ==
0.9.1 - Fixed issue so healing beams work better and hull gets healed by default if the hull was hit and damaged but no other system was affected
0.9 - Added counter for Alex SL Gato's TachyonBeam Technology 
0.8 - Added Borg Detector to the list of Borg ships with this perk
0.7 - now torpedoes, pulses and phasers may get resisted as well
0.6 - made all the counters modular so they are in scripts/Custom/Techs/BorgAdaptationsDefensive, in order to prevent people trying to monkey-patch the file.
0.5 - added the modified KM Borg Custom/ships files: BorgDiamond, borgshuttle, LowCube, and Sphere
0.4 - first unofficial release of this mod, for feedback

== What does this mod do ==
This mod makes ships with the appropiate Technology gain an immunity over time - specifically borg immunity, so all ships with this share the same immunity over time.
That way if you mod the Cubes to share this adaptation tech, eventually all ships with the tech will become immune to special techs.
It also allows for expansion without the need of a monkey patch, by adding a file with an specific format to the scripts/Custom/Techs/BorgAdaptationsDefensive.

For more details, read the licenses and readmes inside each file - I've done it that way so people can still use them if they separate, plus the addition is not automatic to the techs - you must include it properly.

== Dependancies ==
All of these must be installed before installing this mod, in this order:
* Foundation + Kobayashi Maru + DS9FX (KM has Foundation and DS9FX already installed - the most recent version of KM, the better).

* Everyone involved in Foundation - without you this would have been a real pain to do (please read the separate Foundation.txt license) - Banbury, Dasher42, DigitalFriend, MLeo, Nanobyte and Sleight42, among others
* Everyone involved in KM - specifically those involved in the creation of armour and Shields.py (FoundationTechnologies) and the AdvArmorTech.py - Apollo from ATP Technologies as well.
* Dasher42 for some loading scripts to prevent monkey patching, and USS Sovereign for advice in structures regarding monkey patching.
* Grey da Derg#2305 for helping with noticing bugs and their cause.
* Grim455#4905 aka THE SCI-FI KING, for beign inquisitive and finding out possible ways to tweak the hardpoints and techs.
* Alex SL Gato (aka CharaToLoki) for any new code implemented or modified - specifically the BorgAdaptation.py and the SG Hopping Torpedo file inside BorgAdaptationsDefensive folder.
