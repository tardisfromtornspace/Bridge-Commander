== Changelog ==
1.9.1 - - Automated Destroyed System Repair 0.51
- Just fixed a typo on the documentation.
1.9 - Automated Destroyed System Repair 0.5
- Bugfix about singletons
- Bugfix/workaround around pShip.RemoveVisibleDamage() bug that the .exe has
1.8 - Borg Adapttion script 1.31
- Bugfix related with findShipInstance
1.7 - Automated Destroyed System Repair 0.4
- Bugfix where an error could lead to a random ship possibly gaining part of these repairs where it shouldn't.
- Improved cleanup.
1.6 - Automated Destroyed System Repair 0.3.
1.5 - Automated Destroyed System Repair 0.2 added to the Stock Borg KM Ships.
1.4 - Borg Adaptation script 1.2 
- Bugfix with randomness being detrimental for resistances
- Fixed bad CA 8472 form which did not give immunity. Now it has.
1.3 - Borg Adaptation script 1.1
* What is new:
- Bugfix, it was possible that the Hull could heal twice if it was not targetable, that now has been fixed.
1.2 - Borg Adaptation script 0.9 and 1.0
* What is new in 0.9 
- now offensive capabilities also adapt, basically increasing the damage dealt by Borg Adaptive ships. Phasers, Torpedoes, Pulses and Tractors count as learning tools.
-- with this, now ships can be made more resistant to this, and even use it to resist borg weapons even better - f.ex. CA8472 ship.
- slightly reduced the capability
* What is new in 1.0 
- scanning a target or an area as a Borg adaptive vessel will also work towards learning from nearby ships and any torpedo or pulse close enough.
- Improved manual/instructions of use on the script page itself.
- Added examples of scripts that make it harder for the Borg to "adapt" - including 8472 Bioships and Weapons and some Babylon 5 Bioships and weapons.
1.1 - Borg Adaptation script 0.8:
* Fixed a bug that randomly made some subsystems heal from attacks at the cost of other subsystems not being protected. Now it works as it should and covers all systems evenly in all situations.
* Made the technology tougher by allowing shields to also beneift from this and small tweaks that reduced the gap damage slightly.
1.0 - Official Release
0.9.1 - Fixed issue so healing beams work better and hull gets healed by default if the hull was hit and damaged but no other system was affected
0.9 - Added counter for Alex SL Gato's TachyonBeam Technology 
0.8 - Added Borg Detector to the list of Borg ships with this perk
0.7 - now torpedoes, pulses and phasers may get resisted as well
0.6 - made all the counters modular so they are in scripts/Custom/Techs/BorgAdaptationsDefensive, in order to prevent people trying to monkey-patch the file.
0.5 - added the modified KM Borg Custom/ships files: BorgDiamond, borgshuttle, LowCube, and Sphere
0.4 - first unofficial release of this mod, for feedback

== What does this mod do ==
This mod makes ships with the appropiate Technology gain an immunity over time - specifically borg immunity, so all ships with this share the same immunity over time.
From 0.9 onwards, it also works onto making ships with this technology to "learn" how to deal super-effective damage towards targets.
That way if you mod the Cubes to share this adaptation tech, eventually all ships with the tech will become immune to special techs or will have it easier to destroy more advanced vessels.

It also allows for expansion without the need of a monkey patch, by adding a file with an specific format to the scripts/Custom/Techs/BorgAdaptationsDefensive.

For more details, read the licenses and readmes inside each file - I've done it that way so people can still use them if they separate, plus the addition is not automatic to the techs - you must include it properly.

== Dependancies ==
All of these must be installed before installing this mod, in this order:
* Foundation + Kobayashi Maru + DS9FX (KM has Foundation and DS9FX already installed - the most recent version of KM, the better).

== Credits ==
* Everyone involved in Foundation - without you this would have been a real pain to do (please read the separate Foundation.txt license) - Banbury, Dasher42, DigitalFriend, MLeo, Nanobyte and Sleight42, among others
* Everyone involved in KM - specifically those involved in the creation of armour and Shields.py (FoundationTechnologies) and the AdvArmorTech.py - Apollo from ATP Technologies as well.
* Dasher42 for some loading scripts to prevent monkey patching, and USS Sovereign for advice in structures regarding monkey patching.
* Grey da Derg#2305 for helping with noticing bugs and their cause.
* Grim455#4905 aka THE SCI-FI KING, for beign inquisitive and finding out possible ways to tweak the hardpoints and techs.
* Alex SL Gato (aka CharaToLoki) for any new code implemented or modified - specifically the BorgAdaptation.py and the SG Hopping Torpedo file inside BorgAdaptationsDefensive folder.
