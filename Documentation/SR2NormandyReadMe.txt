1.1 DESCRIPTION :

Bones proudly presents : Normandy SR-2 and SSV Normandy SR2 from upcoming Mass Effect 3
The Normandy SR-2 is a starship that appears in Mass Effect 2, serving as the "successor" to the SR-1. The Illusive Man had Cerberus build the SR-2 for the newly revived Commander Shepard's team to aid them in their mission to stop the Collectors galaxy-wide campaign of human abductions. This ship is the headquarters of the Lazarus Cell. The ship is very similar to the Systems Alliance's SSV Normandy SR-1, having been based on the design layout of the original. The Normandy SR-2 has several key differences, the most significant being that it is approximately twice the size of the original.


1.2 TECHNICAL DATA :

Normandy SR-2/SSV Normandy SR-2, Cerberus frigate/Alliance stealth frigate 	
-2x Javelin Disruptor Torpedo (1 launcher per side = 5 torpedoes per 1 launcher)
-2x defense cannons 	-2x GARDIAN defense laser
-Multicore CBT Shielding
-Heavy ablative armor


1.3 MOD INFO :

Model and textures were extracted from Mass Effect 2 and converted for Bridge Commander, only glows and specaular highlights were altered to suit BC graphic engine so the ship appears the same as it was in ME2. Hardpoints are not 100% match with what appeared in game, in example there is no Thanix cannon on the underside of the ship, mainly due to BC engine restrictions ( Thanix cannons had to be deployed from underside of the hull before they could be fired), now I know we could do it via MVAM but it wouldn't be too practical in use, instead of Thanix cannnons I've put 2 pulse fire cannons on wings, inbetween both engines.
