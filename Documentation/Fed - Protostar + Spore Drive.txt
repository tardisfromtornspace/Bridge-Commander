== Changelog ==
0.4.5 - Updates:
  * Removed the Updated NormalWarp and EnhancedWarp, which I did not know were All Rights Reserved and could not be modified directly.
  * Created scripts/Custom/Autoload/FIX-GCNormalWarpAndEnhancedWarp.py, which fixes NormalWarp and EnhancedWarp via monkey patching, preventing a license violation.
  * Giving extra credit to USS Sovereign for helping me notice the legal issue above and how to fix it.
0.4.4 - Updates:
  * Updated NormalWarp and EnhancedWarp to version 20241212 to fix camera issues and support warp stretchiness again when using GC.
  * Updated SporeDrive to 0.3 to grant better speeds.
  * Updated Crossfield Custom/Ships file to cap warp speed at warp 7.0 like a very-early TOS vessel.
0.4.3 - Updates:
  * Updated Crossfield, SporeDrive and Spore Drive sounds to be a bit faster.
0.4.2 - Updates:
  * Updated AlternateSubModelFTL to 0.81 to so when a ship cannot move, it says "CANNOT DO" instead of just "CANNOT".
0.4.1 - Updates:
  * Updated SporeDrive to 0.2 to allow ISI to have a customizable chance to uncloak nearby vessels without phase cloak.
0.4 - Updates:
  * Updated AlternateSubModelFTL to 0.8 to give the script intra-system-intercept (ISI) support.
  * Updated SporeDrive to 0.19 to cover ISI support.
  * Updated readmes to cover use-conditions for the script, per USS Sovereign's request (and necessary condition for use).
0.3.6 - Updates:
  * Updated AlternateSubModelFTL to 0.76 to fix a bug with hardpoints not returning to normal after FTL.
  * Updated USSProtostar and USS Discovery hardpoints so all properties now have a proper 2DPosition.
  * Updated SporeDrive to 0.16 to fix the camera rotating issue and made it so people can tow ships.
0.3.5 - Updates:
  * Updated AlternateSubModelFTL to 0.75 to support the option to only perform entry or exit FTL sequences for each part and FTL method individually.
  * Updated SporeDrive to 0.15 to cover the new update to AlternateSubModelFTL.
0.3.4 - Updates:
  * Added a fragment of the Spore Drive - still missing proper flash textures and in-system interception!
  * Updated Documentation to fill these gaps.
0.3.3 - Updates:
  * Updated AlternateSubModelFTL to 0.71, fixing a potential issue related with different MissionLib files.
0.3.2 - Updates:
  * Updated scripts/Custom/Ships file to provide the full list of parts also in-game, pending of model repalcement and position/rotation adjustment.
0.3.1 - Updates:
  * Updated ProtoWarp TravellingMethod to 0.31, providing starting sound.
  * Updated scripts/Custom/Ships file to provide a more extensive list on what moves on the Protostar (as a list to help Greystar with models).
0.3 - Updated AlternateSubModelFTL to 0.7, finally making the tech independent from SubModels as well as fixing a weird non-experimental lights bug.
0.2 - Updated AlternateSubModelFTL to 0.64, fixed the rapid-change drifting for the most part, also now Experimental is no longer ugly at the beginning.
0.1 - First unofficial release, for testing

== What does this mod do ==
This mod adds the following updates and fixes:
* A new SubModels-derivated file that supports other FTL methods (from GalaxyCharts) and mobility fix and intra-system intercept (ISI) improvements.
* Proto-Warp Travelling Method.
** An USS Protostar from Star Trek Prodigy equipped with this drive (TO-DO W.I.P.).
** An USS Prodigy from Star Trek Prodigy equipped with this drive (TO-DO not yet added).
* Spore-Drive Travelling Method with ISI.
** A modified USS Discovery (Crossfield Class) equipped with Spore drive.
* Fixed NormalWarp and EnhancedWarp travelling methods:
** Now they support the ship stretching when it goes in an out of warp!
** The camera no longer gets a stroke when a ship is warping in or out, switching to several places and then having the warp flash on our face! Now they behave properly!
** Small allowance for max warp 10.0 as some vessels might allow that speed factor with regular warp methods.

All of the technologies have their own detailed instruction manuals inside the files to ensure people can use those techs easily.

== Dependencies ==
All of these must be installed before installing this mod, in this order:
* Foundation + Kobayashi Maru (KM has Foundation already installed - the most recent version of KM, the better).
* GalaxyCharts (KM has this mod already installed. Required for ProtoWarp TravellingMethod and any method you may want derived from that).
* All the dependencies for this mod + the mod: https://www.gamefront.com/games/bridge-commander/file/stbc-babylon-5-mod
** From here, HullPolarizer is the most used, but also the file "FIX-FoundationTech20050703ShipInstanceDetach.py", which solves problems related with iterating lTechs when detaching and removing from such FoundationTech list.
* This mod, for the ST:Discovery original Crossfield class: https://www.gamefront.com/games/bridge-commander/file/crossfield-class

== Credits ==
* Everyone involved in Foundation - without you this would have been a real pain to do (please read the separate Foundation.txt license) - Banbury, Dasher42, DigitalFriend, MLeo, Nanobyte and Sleight42, among others.
* Everyone involved in KM - specifically those involved in the creation of armour and Shields.py (FoundationTechnologies) the AdvArmorTech.py, FiveSecsGodPhaser.py, TractorBeams.py - Apollo from ATP Technologies as well.
* Dasher42 for reminding me of licensing.
* USS Sovereign for some DS9FX advice regarding timers, inspired in one of DS9FX Pulsar files for improved rotations, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, for giving me permission to adopt fragments of his Slipstream Module for Intra-System-Intercept. Those sections, while still modified to be adjusted to the script, still fall under "All Rights Reserved" so you cannot modify or repacakge them without USS Sovereign's permission!
** Again USS Sovereign for helping me notice NormalWarp and EnhancedWarp were All Rights Reserved by USS Frontier and could not be modified directly without violating such license, helping me from suffering a legal headache.
* USS Frontier for GalaxyCharts.
* Defiant for some scripts that drew inspiration (or were practically used as a base), particularly the original SubModels.
* WileyCoyote (michaelwileyart@gmail.com) for the Crossfield Phaser sounds (already mentioned of the Crossfield's separate readme).
* That Guy... Brian (ThatGuyBrian, trekker12@hotmail.com) - for Model Conversion of the original Protostar and Crossfield models (already mentioned on the Crossfield's separate readme), the Crossfield original HP (already mentioned on the Crossfield's separate readme), and for telling me to install Nifskope, that tool has proven to be very useful to me.
** Prodigy model extracted from Star Trek Prodigy: Supernova. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BMaT2_i5KBIqZ5Am1Hr4vK-81yZQ9GsE/view
** Original Crossfield model (from the aforementioned https://www.gamefront.com/games/bridge-commander/file/crossfield-class) ported from Star Trek: Adversaries (https://store.steampowered.com/app/815040/Star_Trek_Adversaries/)

* Original ST:Discovery torpedoes by Zambie Zan, alexandre.marques@gmail.com (already mentioned on the Crossfield's separate readme).
* Everyone else from the other mods I mentioned, which have their own readmes crediting them - please feel free to contact me (tardis#2540 on Discord, CharaToLoki on Gamefront) to correct any potential issues, thank you.
* Michael Giachinno for the ST Prodigy Intro music.
* Bonnie Gordon for the Protostar computer voice.
* Tools used: Milkshape 3D and FreeCAD for extensive modifications and adjustments to the original Andromeda Model, Nifskope to validate the textures, GIMP to modify and create textures and icons, Model Property Editor to iron.out a few hardpoint issues, Audacity to fix some sounds.
* Grey da Derg#2305, Grim455#4905 aka THE SCI-FI KING, HexagonalNexul and MSR1701 for helping with noticing bugs and their cause, and for being inquisitive and finding out possible ways to tweak the hardpoints and techs and models.
* Alex SL Gato (aka CharaToLoki) for any new code or model implemented, fixed or modified (including all the monkey patches and the icon), plus the original fusion idea I had, based on a Spore Andromeda-Talyn fusion (image provided on Documentation/AndromedaTalynOriginalSporeIdea.png), and the Spear model.
