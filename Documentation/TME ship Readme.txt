(in order of creation)

TME Galaxy X FH: A Galaxy X Class built and modified by an evil version of Retro Badger Gaming in some unholy alternate timeline.

TME Ghost Ship: In the Bizzaro universe, which was also the origin point for The Most Evil Galaxy X from Hell, the Ghost 1701 was created from the spiteful spirits that were reluctant to die when the Enterprise self destructed. 
		This ship has one mission and one mission only... To hunt down and destroy the one who killed them... James T. kirk. It will stop at nothing to achieve its goals, and if you dare stand in its way, I doubt you will survive long.

TME Excelsior: Due to some unforeseen circumstances, a race that used Universal Improbability technology (magic) created a ship from a dead wreck they found in some Unholy reality. 
	       They Used this ship to terrorize their universe for the crimes it had committed
