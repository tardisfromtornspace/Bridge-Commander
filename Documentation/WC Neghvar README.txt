About--------------------
The Negh'Var class was a powerful new form of warship developed by the Klingon Empire in secret, with very few even among the Klingon High Council knowing of the project's existence. It was a significant departure from "traditional" Klingon designs which favored swift, agile vessels, instead offering heavy firepower and pure brute strength.

Negh'Var class ships were larger than Starfleet's Galaxy-class ships, and were capable of carrying a security detail of 2,700 personnel. They were armed with disruptors, heavy disruptors and photon torpedoes.
-from Memory Beta.wikia.com

Textures are 2048 pixel resolution and are very crisp.
