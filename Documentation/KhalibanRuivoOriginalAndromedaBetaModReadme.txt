Ship Description:



"As the most visible symbol of the Commonwealth, command of these vessels is reserved for the most talented commanders. Capable of high-endurance, independent operations, the Heavy Cruiser nonetheless operates most often as the central component of an HCBG. They are ideally suited for interplanetary combat, although they can play a significant role in planetary strike operations and logistics support for the HCBG as a whole. 



Also, XMCs are often called upon to perform disaster relief and refugee support operations due to their spacious interiors and ability to ferry large quantities of emergency supplies and additional personnel. During peacetime, XMCs are most often tasked with independent intergalactic exploration, charting and documenting the star systems of the Local Cluster. They are also the preferred platform for first contact missions, given their formidable combat capabilities and their ability to operate without a battlegroup - often critical in assuring that the High Guard comes in peace."
