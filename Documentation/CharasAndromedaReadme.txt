This mod is a modification on an older mod I could not remember. The older mod had mostly normal technologies, moved by warp drive and had an energy shield. This change intends to make it more canon

1.0 Mod release. Changes compared with the original Andromeda:
* Adjusted weaponry, defenses and explosive power.
** Shields and hull are far, far weaker but now can rebound some incoming projectiles, the shields adapt a bit, the ship has (manual) Point Defence and has some Armor now, and regenerates a bit faster.
** Additionally some of their torpedoes can hit their target at lightminutes from the target.
** If necessary the Androemda can blow a planet as well.
** No warp drive, only Slipstream engine -> DOWNLOAD SLIPSTREAM MOD IF YOU WANT TO LEAVE A SYSTEM.
** Battle blades!
