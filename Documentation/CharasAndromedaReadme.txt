This mod is a modification on an older mod I could not remember. The older mod had mostly normal technologies, moved by warp drive and had an energy shield. This change intends to make it more canon
== Changelog ==
1.1.8 -
   Fixes:
   * Found out that Defiant's Power system could glitch out if a ship had impulse engines but no warp engines. The new Autoload patch "FIX-DefiantsQBautostartPower1dot0.py" aims to resolve that issue.
1.1.7 - Fixes:
   * Updated Andromeda's 'Nova Bomb' projectile to prevent a possible issue from UniMod's implementation.
1.1.6 - Fixes:
   * Updated Andromeda's ship file so holes are less pronounced, updated armour and hull regeneration to be a bit more realistic, re-updated torpedoes and "shields" to reflect this and fixing a bug.
1.1.5 - Misc. changes & Potential Bug Fixing:
   * Updated Simulated Point Defense so one of its configurations works regardless of MissionLib custom settings.
1.1.4 - Misc. changes & Bug Fixing:
   * Updated all Slipfighter Custom/Ships files so they are under a SubSubMenu.
   * Fixed an error on the original hardpoint that was preventing the Andromeda and other variant ships from actually using their torpedo launchers at max.
1.1.3 - Misc. changes:
   * Updated Simulated Point Defence from 0.91 to 0.92 - this will not make the ship target projectiles that have same parent and target ID (update for compatibility with the SG Drone weaponry from CanonicalAlteranTechnologies).
1.1.2 - Bug Fixing:
 * Updated Simulated Point Defence 0.91 to 0.92 - it is so slightly tiny bit slower, but reduces some collision issues.
1.1.1 - Features
 * Fixed battle blades color and added the two lower battle blades.
1.1.0 - Bug Fixing
 * Upgraded Simulated Point Defence to 0.91, removing a potential issue with singletons.
1.0.9 - Bug Fixing
 * Upgraded Simulated Point Defence from 0.8 to 0.9, now two possible crash causes upon heavy fire have been removed. Thank USS Sovereign for telling me how to use the debug function properly.
1.0.8 - Bug Fixing
 * Upgraded Simulated Point Defence from 0.6 to 0.8, now a lot of the weird behaviour happening before has been fixed.
1.0.7 - Bug fixing
 * Fixed Simulated Point Defence TypeError sequence issue - it didn't really cause any problems but it was flagged on the console and would have caused problems if the sequence had multiple actions.
1.0.6
* Fixed a bug with Simulated Point Defence Tech
1.0.5
* Improved the Simulated Point Defence Tech
1.0.4
* Added a total-side point-defence EXPERIMENTAL technology which allows the ships to be more realistic - only kept shields on the Andromeda to allow the reflector shield effect, everything else fully canon now with no shields.
1.0.2
* Added multi-targetting technology
1.0.1
* Updated missing ValiantMissile
1.0 Mod release. Changes compared with the original Andromeda:
* Adjusted weaponry, defenses and explosive power.
** Shields and hull are far, far weaker but now can rebound some incoming projectiles, the shields adapt a bit, the ship has (manual) Point Defence and has some Armor now, and regenerates a bit faster.
** Additionally some of their torpedoes can hit their target at lightminutes from the target.
** If necessary the Androemda can blow a planet as well.
** No warp drive, only Slipstream engine -> DOWNLOAD SLIPSTREAM MOD IF YOU WANT TO LEAVE A SYSTEM.
** Battle blades!

Requirements: FoundationTechnologies, Slipstream Mod (the latest, the better), Kobayashi Maru
