* MLeo's Sub Menu Mod v.3

Model Discription:
_______________

This is a "Total" rework of the 9 of 9 Defiant.
 
This Model will not overwright any other models. This is the first in a fleet to Defiants to be released, customized to
counter the Borg threat. As mentioned by Commander Shelby, Starfleet Research and Development would be making many new
innovative ships and weapons. In the TNG 4th season episode "The Best of Both Worlds Pt. II. The Defiant Class will display
what was developed "In Theory". Since the Borg would not be able to "Adapt" as quickly to the different Defiant weapon
configurations.

This Mod will not replace the previous Defiant Class USS Defiant v.1. This mod is compatible with Apollo's Advanced
Technologies Pack (ATP 2 & 3). Using the latest version of Sub Menu v3 by MLeo. And any QB/ QBR/ QBA and KM mods.
Keep in mind, the ship is balanced for ingame play, and may not follow canon dictates. 
Our Main Objective here is "ingame" playability. . .

U.S.S. DEFIANT * NX-74205
________________________________

* 4x Pulse Phasers
* Dual Forward and Single Aft Quantum Torpedo Launchers.
* Enhanced Shield System
* Lateral Phasers
* Dorsal Phaser Turret
* High Manuverability
* Reinforced Primary Systems
* High Acceleration
* Immune to the Breen Energy Drain Weapon (ATP v.2 or 3 required)
* Ablative Armour

* Note: The First Starship designed to counter the Borg threat, The NX Defiant was "mothballed" when the
Borg threat became less urgent. The Defiant Class proved invaluable during the Dominion Wars. Though
classified as a "Escort", The Defiant Class is a "Warship" pure and simple.
