This is my Second Ship The Abunai (Dangerous) Class This is a GOD ship that
can finish big fleets in seconds.
The Phasers can Fire 360° around the ship and have a range of ca. 116 Km
The Torpedos (Drones) Can pass a targets Shields.
And the Quantum Torpedo Launcher can fire a with hi-speed and Reload Quickly(IT`s a Pulse Weapon).


I Hope it`s OK that I used scripts and sfx from two Other Mod`s 

1 . Stargate pack 3.0 (Drones)

2 . CRtacticalcube_revised (Cutter)

I Hope you Enjoy it!
